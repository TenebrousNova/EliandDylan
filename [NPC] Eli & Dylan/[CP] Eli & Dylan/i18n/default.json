//IMPORTANT DATES

"Core.NovaEli.Spring.2.2": "Hello there, farmer! Must be a relief for you to start planting stuff again.$1#$b#I like Winter myself, but most of my income comes from dungeon delving anyway.$0#$b#Not that I make much.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.3.1": "Joja made a right cock-up of their 'drilling operation' in the mountains. Thanks to them the pass leading to the railroad is totally blocked off by rubble.$9#$b#The mines, too! I get that they're a necessary evil because the local economy is strapped, but I wish Lewis would tell Morris where he can stick his jackhammer.$8",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.12": "Looking forward to tomorrow's bash at the town square? I kind of envy you for being allowed to take part in the egg hunt.$0#$b#Mayor Lewis takes issue with my age and Dylan seems to think I'd cheat. And Rasmodius. And half my neighbours. As if I would!$11#$e#Still, I'm not yet barred from the food. You better get there before I do, farmer.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.23": "I'll be honest, I'm not looking forward to the Flower Dance. We had to rent these ugly suits from a place in Grampleton.$2#$b#Also, there's no way anyone would want to dance with me after the first time.$9#$b#What happened? ...Another time. I wouldn't want you to feel second hand shame.$12#$e#I don't care what people think, I refuse to shave for the festival.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.27": "I can't believe we're almost into Summer already. Imagine it, @.$0#$b#Swimming in the sparkling ocean by day, watching the fireflies dance at night... and those strange ritualistic sacrifices the townsfolk make to the Junimos under a blood moon.$1#$e#Haha, relax! I'm just yanking your chain. You don't HAVE to go swimming if you don't want to.$6",


"Core.NovaEli.Summer.10": "Tomorrow's gonna be fantastic, farmer. The Luau is one of those occasions that really make you feel like part of the community.$1#$b#Sure, Point Drake has its festivals and they're not bad at all. But they just don't have that wholesome energy you get at small town events, you know?$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Summer.27": "I'm going to need to have a little word with Dylan before we go out to the beach tomorrow evening...$9#$b#He has to be reminded sometimes that he's meant to relax and enjoy the Lunaloos, instead of scribbling notes on their behaviour and recording their numbers the whole night.$10#$e#I love my work too, but it's important to separate it from your life sometimes, you know?$0",

"Core.NovaEli.Fall.15": "Hey farmer, are you nervous about tomorrow's fair? You shouldn't be! You'll knock the rest of them out of the park, I know it.$1#$b#Me? I'll definitely be there. Although I might also take the trip to Grampleton to see what theirs is like.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Fall.17": "@! Dylan probably didn't tell you, but it's his birthday tomorrow. He never expects people to make a big fuss over it.$1#$b#He always gets totally flustered when people get him a present, though.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.Fall.26": "I hope you're ready for the one day of the year that it's 'socially acceptable' for people to get done up in spooky costumes, @!$1#$b#I told Dylan I want to get some real work done since supernatural forces will be at their peak, but he went and called me out for hypocrisy.$8#$e#I'm still going to do it anyway once the festivities die down. It's an opportunity I can't afford to waste.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.Fall.28": "Ready for Winter, farmer? I bet it's going to be nice having a whole season where you won't be working the fields.$0#$b#What will you do in the meantime? Go cave diving? Reorganise everything?$1",

"Core.NovaEli.Winter.5": "Man, I can't believe I've got another impending birthday. It's something I never really think about until it's right round the corner.$1#$b#I'll probably just have a nice and quiet day, maybe watch a movie or two. I don't need a big celebration to have a good time.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.7": "Are you going to the Ice Festival tomorrow, @? It's bloody freezing, but worth it just to see the awesome ice sculptures people make.$1#$b#I can't join in, though. The festival takes place in the forest, so I volunteered to keep an eye out for monsters that might get drawn to all the noise.$0#$e#Worry not, farmer. You and everyone else will be quite safe in my capable hands.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.15": "If you're going to the submarine, do me a solid and remind Dylan to at LEAST eat and drink occasionally while he's staring at the deep sea life.$9#$b#I'm one to talk, but he is obsessive. First year, he was literally camped out in that tub. The captain had to ask me to help drag him back out when the Night Market ended.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.16": "In case you're wondering, that Mermaid at the Night Market is the real deal. Patient, too. I've been bombarding her with questions non-stop!$1#$b#What do you mean I have 'confirmation bias'? I'm telling you that she's real! It's literally my JOB to know this stuff!$8",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.17": "The Night Market definitely doesn't help my caffeine addiction, but I'm not gonna complain!$3#$b#That merchant's coffee is something else. I'll be sorry to see her go.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.18": "I got a letter today telling me who my 'secret friend' will be for Winter Star. Got yours as well? Great!$1#$b#Not to worry, I won't ask who it is. I don't need the mayor ranting at me again.$12",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.24": "Me and Dylan never really celebrated Winter Star before we moved to the Valley. We didn't have any reason to.$2#$b#Our first time experiencing it here was very different! We were strangers, misfits, but the folk here went out of their way to welcome us with open arms.$0#$b#And we can't even begin to thank them enough for that. I hope we'll see you celebrating with us tomorrow, @.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.28": "Another year come and gone, farmer. Excited for the next one? I'll bet Pierre has missed you and especially your wallet.$6#$b#As for me, I'll be up to my usual shenanigans. I've a good feeling about next year.$1",

//Festival Lines

"Core.NovaEli.wonEggHunt": "That was some damn good egg hunting, congrats! There's probably going to be people judging you for trouncing the kids, though.$1#$b#Ah well, gotta get them used to disappointment at an early age, right?$3",
"Core.NovaEli.wonGrange": "Pierre was totally sulking when I saw him earlier. You breaking his winning streak at the fair must've stung a little.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.wonIceFishing": "Congrats on winning that ice fishing contest! I'm sorry I wasn't there to cheer you on, but a group of ice slimes showed up during all the excitement.$12#$b#Little buggers thought a whole town's worth of people gathered in one place would be an easy meal, but they thought wrong.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judging": "Oh, Lewis is starting the judging? Sweet! Best of luck to you. Let me know how it goes, yeah?$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerLost_PurpleShorts": "AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH I can't believe you did that, holy shit! The LOOK on the old codger's face!$3#$b#Wait, he BRIBED you as well? I just - I can't -! I need a minute...$7#$b#%Eli is crying from laughing so hard.",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerLost_Skipped": "Oh, you didn't feel up to participating this time? That's too bad. But hey, there's always next year.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerLost": "You lost? Aww, I'm sorry to hear that @. I'm sure you tried your best. And there's always next year, right?$2",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerWon": "You WON?! That's fantastic news @, I knew you had it in you!$3#$b#Pierre's gonna be sulking about this one for a while.$6",

"Core.NovaEli.FlowerDanceAccept": "Dance? With me? Ah, what the hell. I'll try not to screw it up. Alright, let's get this trainwreck started!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.DanceRejection": "Oh! That's sweet of you, @. And on any other day I'd probably say yes. But I don't want a repeat of what happened the last time someone asked me to dance.$2#$b#I'll give you a hint: we both ended up in the clinic shortly after. With multiple fractured bones. You'll find a more competent dance partner, I'm sure.$10",

"Core.NovaEli.WinterStar_GiveGift_Before": "Hey @, it's your lucky day! You're my secret friend this year.$1#$b#I had a hard time deciding what to get you, but I hope you like it. Anyway, get unwrapping!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.WinterStar_GiveGift_After": "Ta-da! That moment never gets old, does it? Take it easy, @ - have a cracking Winter Star.$1",

//0-4 HEARTS

//About Eli

"Core.NovaEli.0-4.1": "My job? I'm a cryptozoologist. I study monsters and try to discover new ones. I've also been doing a lot of research into the supernatural and occult.$1#$b#Yeah, I recognise that expression. Not to worry, I'm used to people thinking I'm a little... eccentric.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.2": "*Yaaaaaaaaawn* Hey @. Didn't get any sleep at all last night...$9#$b#%Eli seems to become completely unresponsive before abruptly jerking awake seconds later.#$b#Where...? Sorry mate... I wouldn't make good company right now.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.3": "I should try to get to the Saloon more often. Not for the drink, I swore off that years ago.$0#$b#But sometimes I just need the company. They think I'm a nutjob, but they seem to tolerate me? Or at least pretend to.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.4": "%Eli seems lost in thought as he idly fidgets with his pendant. You glimpse a gleaming ivory fang, covered in tiny etched runes. Something about it unsettles you.",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.5": "%Eli doesn't notice you as he walks along. He's murmuring strange words to himself. You don't understand them, but hearing them makes your teeth and bones ache.",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.6": "I reckon I'll put on a horror movie tonight. I've seen practically all of them and they're filled with clichés, but they never get old.$1#$b#It's funnier watching them as someone who's regularly at the sharp end. Those clueless movie heroes wouldn't last five seconds against a real monster!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.7": "I wonder what's going on back at Point Drake? It's been a long time since we left the port.$0#$b#Not that I ever plan to leave the Valley! It'll be my home until Lewis finally gets fed up and kicks me out.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.8": "I managed to beat Journey of the Prairie King! I'm dead chuffed, it took me long enough.$3#$b#Dylan was there - he can back me up! He was very impressed. And then he challenged me to beat it without losing any lives.$1#$b#Yeah, no. Not happening. I'm not a masochist.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.9": "One of my favourite things to do at night is go down to the beach and watch the fog come rolling in.$1#$b#It's an otherworldly sight. Sometimes I catch fleeting glimpses of silhouettes in the fog. They're like strange, lost spirits.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.10": "%Eli seems to be in a particularly exuberant mood today, even for him. You struggle to keep up with his excitable babbling before he dashes away.",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.11": "%Eli is vigorously rubbing his eyes. He looks exhausted.#$b#Hi @. Another shitty night... I swear that the sleeping pills Dr. Harvey prescribed me don't work half the time.$9#$b#If you happen to have a tranquilizer gun in that backpack somewhere, preferably one capable of knocking out a Pepper Rex, feel free to use it on me. Please.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.12": "Have you seen much of Ferngill, @? Me, I've spent most of my life in Point Drake. It's a lovely place perched on a peninsula by the Gem Sea.$1#$b#But things didn't work out for us there, so we struck out for Stardew Valley to make a new life.$0#$e#From what I heard, you left the City for similar reasons. I've never been there, but I'd like to visit one day.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.13": "I've actually got a blog on cryptozoology. Something that'll shake the stones of my profession to its very foundations.$0#$b#Well, alright. Barely anyone reads it. But I can't do worse than the amateurs that write sensationalist tabloid garbage like Crypto Today.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.14": "I suppose that if I'm ever hard pressed for cash, I could always have a side gig as a magician for kid's parties or something.$2#$b#I can do one hell of a disappearing act.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.15": "%As Eli greets you, you notice there's this strange reverb to his voice.#$b#MORTAL! What do you think of this effect I'm working on for Spirit's Eve? Answer truly, before I claim your soul as my plaything. For ETERNITY!$19#$b#Haha, fine! I'll stop. I'm really happy with how that turned out though. I should do it in front of those Yoba worshippers on Sunday.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.16": "I tried to give myself a lucid dream last night. You know, when you're fully aware that you're in the dream and can control it?$0#$b#After a while it actually worked! I was there, but was still sort of aware of being in bed. And yeah, I could fly!$1#$b# But then I got so excited that I immediately woke up. Isn't that just bleeding typical.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.17": "How did I get banned from JojaMart? Oh boy, @... fine, I'll give you the short version.$9#$b#The truth is that I tripped over, completely by accident. Which caused a chain reaction that ended in Morris getting publically humiliated.$10#$b#On the plus side, Shane was laughing his head off. He and Sam got me a pizza that night. Said they'll always treasure the memory of Morris crushed beneath those shelves.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.18": "Growing up, I learned fast that I shouldn't care about being different from others. That I should embrace my quirks.$1#$b#Who wants to be 'normal', anyway? If everyone was normal, the world would be a very boring place.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.19": "%Eli is fidgeting with his pendant and notices you looking at it.#$b#Oh, this? It's a talisman I carved myself. Has some strong magic. It's a fang from a Sea Drake!$1#$b#Point Drake was named after them - it was once their nesting ground. A lot of people think they're long extinct or never even existed, but I know they're out there. This is proof.$3#$b#It's a big reason that I went into cryptozoology in the first place. Neat, huh?$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.20": "What's up, @. It's a good day isn't it? Uh... how come you're staring at me like that?$17#$b#Well, I guess you're only human.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.21": "I was on the Community Center roof earlier- while Lewis wasn't looking of course. I spend quite a lot of time on rooftops.$0#$b#You should join me one evening! Watching people go about their business below, enjoying town from a new perspective. It makes you feel wild and free.$1#$e#Don't fret, farmer! I'd always be there to catch you.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.22": "Do you ever get the feeling that people act friendly to your face, but they're just too polite to say what they really think?$9#$b#That's how I feel with most people who talk to me. I know what I'm like, @. Sorry if I've ever been obnoxious around you.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.23": "I had an unsettling dream last night. I was back at Point Drake, walking down the dimly lit street to our old apartment block. The door was unlocked, so I went in.$0#$b#The furniture was how I remembered, but every surface was covered in thick dust. There was no one around. Then the door bell rang behind me.$9#$b#I opened the door and whatever it was, it was terrifying enough that I woke up at 3am. I think it had my face.$2#$e#I immediately brewed myself a coffee. And Dr. Harvey wonders why I have trouble sleeping...$9",

//About Family

"Core.NovaEli.0-4.24": "Don't worry if Dylan seems short with you. He's a bit slow to trust and doesn't spend much time around people.$0#$b#He's a marine biologist. Get him on the subject of sea life and he won't shut up.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.25": "I caught Soot trying to get into the cupboards this morning, bless him. Luckily Dylan wasn't there.$3#$b#I get that a Dust Sprite is a really unusual pet, but how could I not? Yeah, he's a rascal and he's still a bit feral. But he's way too adorable to get mad at.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.26": "I took Soot to the vet the other day for a checkup. You should've seen the look on Jacob's face!$0#$b#'But Eli, I wasn't taught how to treat monsters at veterinary school!'$11#$b#Maybe he should branch out! Become a monster vet as well, then I can get Soot microchipped.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.27": "Dylan's fancy aquarium hypnotises me sometimes - there's an entire ecosystem in there that I could honestly stare at for hours on end.$1#$b#I don't trust that octopus of his, though. She's always watching. Always plotting.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.28": "Having a Dust Sprite for a pet has surprising benefits. Did you know that they actually feed on dust and detritus of all kinds? They sort of absorb it.$1#$b#Just don't upset him or he'll expel that dust everywhere. We've learned that the hard way.$10",

//About Friends & Neighbours

"Core.NovaEli.0-4.29": "Aideen chewed me out earlier because I tripped and almost faceplanted in the flowers outside her garden fence.$10#$b#Don't let that woman fool you, @. She might seem kindly, but she could flay you alive with that viciously barbed tongue of hers.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.30": "Have you checked out the East Scarp Inn? It's not quite as lively as Gus's place but it's still a fun place to hang out.$0#$b#Rosa's a kind soul! She listens to me nattering on about my work with great patience.$1#$b#She even asks questions. I'm grateful for that.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.31": "I've never actually met a Vampire before, but I know they're out there. Most people would never know their friend or neighbour's a bloodsucker until it's too late.$9#$b#Hmm... what about that Sebastian kid? Alabaster complexion, edgy fashion, secretive nature...$11#$e#What if Abigail's one of them too? Sweet Yoba's backside, what sinister conspiracy have I stumbled upon?! What if they're ALL in on it?$7#$b#This stays between us, @. Nobody can ever know that we know.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.32": "I rather like that Emily. She's non-judgemental and doesn't look at me like I've grown an extra head whenever I open my gob.$0#$b#Pretty sure she's a devout worshipper of Yoba, though. She might not be so open minded if she knew about the kind of things I dabble in.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.33": "That Abigail seems really interested in my work! She's always pelting me with questions when I stop by Pierre's for groceries.$1#$b#She's got a lot of potential. All she's lacking is the confidence to really go for it. Also I heard rumours that-$0#$b#...Nevermind, @. It's just gossip. I shouldn't listen to Dylan so much.$12",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.34": "I bumped into Elliott the other day and he offered me coffee over his campfire. He's a decent bloke, good at reading people and always has good advice.$1#$b#I asked if he'd ever consider writing horror and he said he'd give it some thought. I think he prefers to write sappy romance, though.$3#$e#I mean, look at him. The man looks and dresses like he walked straight off the front cover of a romance novel.$0#$b#I should ask him if he'd let me have an early sneak peek at his work. I like romance!

"Gifts.NovaEli.GiftReaction.DwarfScrollIII": "It's a good job that the Smoluanu leave their writings on scrolls like this, because nobody's been able to understand their technology enough to get useful info.$1",

//IMPORTANT DATES

"Core.NovaDylan.Spring.2.2": "Alright, @? Bet you're eager to get back to farming. Did you find it hard to keep yourself busy in Winter?$1#$b#Heh, me? The work never ends. But it helps that I enjoy it.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Spring.3.1": "I'm not sure how Joja managed to screw up that badly up in the mountain... they're lucky that no one got hurt or killed when the rocks fell.$8#$b#You won't be able to get to the mines until they've cleaned up their mess. Eli's pretty pissed about it. Can't blame him.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.Spring.12": "Looks like the Egg Festival is on tomorrow. I don't understand the egg fixation for the day, but it's enjoyable. The food's great!$1#$b#You might want to get to it early or Eli's liable to devour it all. He's still salty that Lewis won't let him participate in the egg hunt.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Spring.23": "Why do I have to go to the Flower Dance? Why? I'd literally rather eat a bucket of broken glass than subject myself to that.$7#$b#What if someone asks me to dance? I'd look a right moron in front of everyone!$6#$b#I guess it could be worse. You should've seen what happened when someone asked Eli to dance the first year.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Spring.27": "It's almost Summer! Are you looking forward to it? I know I am. I'm going to get so much done.$1#$b#I'm so glad I live right next to the beach.$3",

"Core.NovaDylan.Summer.10": "Luau's tomorrow, farmer. Normally it'd be way too loud for someone like me but the atmosphere is actually really nice.$1#$b#The potluck soup is an interesting tradition, if a bit risky. You weren't here for Sam's anchovy incident, but it was pretty hilarious.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Summer.27": "Oh, man. You wait til you see tomorrow night's festival @. You'll love it.$3#$b#The same night every year, the Lunaloos stop by Pelican Town's beach on their annual migration. I'm not sure why they come to this place in particular.$0#$e#Eli will probably try and talk me out of spending the evening working, but it's an important opportunity. Besides, HE works on Spirit's Eve.$5#$b#What can I say? We're both obsessed with our work.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.Fall.15": "Don't know about you @, but I'm tempted to spend tomorrow indoors. Lewis is about to open the floodgates and unleash a tide of obnoxious tourists upon us.$2#$b#Don't get me wrong! The Fair is fun. Just a bit too hectic for me.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.Fall.26": "I actually can't wait for Spirit's Eve! I love it almost as much as Eli does. Seeing everyone in their costumes is always amazing.$3#$b#I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty damn happy with how mine turned out. My brother's gonna have competition this year.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Fall.28": "Winter is coming, @. Got any plans for the season? It's as good a time as any to take up fishing if you need the cash.$0#$b#If that's too dull for you, Eli would be ecstatic if you joined him in the mines or Skull Cavern. Just make sure he doesn't get himself killed.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.5": "Hey, @. Just wanted to let you know that Eli's birthday is tomorrow. There's no pressure or anything, but I'm sure he'd appreciate you stopping by.$1#$b#We never do big celebrations, really. We'll probably be at the Saloon for a bit tomorrow night. I can put up with the crowd for him.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.7": "Better wrap up warm for tomorrow! I like the Ice Festival. There's something magical about seeing everyone building ice sculptures and snowmen.$0#$b#There's also an ice fishing competition. Don't tell Willy, but I reckon you stand a fair chance of pinching his crown this year.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.15": "I've been waiting for the Night Market all year, @! It's my favourite event. This submarine is amazing!$1#$b#And whether Eli likes it or not, I'm going to be spending as much time here as possible. I don't get many chances to work with deep sea life. Just TRY and stop me.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.16": "The Mermaids? Yeah, they're real! I've seen them from the submarine and no human could survive unassisted at those depths. You'd implode.$3#$b#There's also one who puts on a show in one of the boats. She has some fascinating tales. Hopefully Eli doesn't scare her off.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.17": "The last day of the Night Market... I've gotta make this one count. It's a shame I can't persuade the submarine captain to stop by the Valley more often.$2#$b#Maybe I'll leave early though. And try to actually enjoy the other things there while I still can.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.18": "We got our Winter Star letters this morning. Got yours yet?$0#$b#We already told each other who our secret friends are. What Lewis doesn't know won't hurt him.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.24": "Eli and I aren't used to bothering with Winter Star, but it holds a different meaning to us now that we live here.$1#$b#I hope you show up. You're welcome to hang out with us.$3",

//0-4 HEARTS

//About Dylan

"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.1": "Oh... my job? Marine biologist. Recently graduated, but still. You'll usually find me doing field work on one of the beaches.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.2": "%Dylan looks like he has a vicious migraine right now.#$b#...Not the time, farmer. Please don't bother me...$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.3": "I've never been to the City. What's it like?$0#$b#Huh. Very different to what I'm used to. We're from Point Drake and it's much busier than Pelican Town, but it's not on that scale.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.4": "%Dylan's got another of his migraines. He scowls at you when you try to say hello. Maybe you should see him another day.",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.5": "The Saloon's usually too busy for me, but sometimes I visit the Inn. It's just as warm and welcoming, but not as overwhelmingly busy.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.6": "This season makes me want to go on vacation. Go scuba diving among the reefs you find in the warm and shallow waters off the Fern Islands.$1#$b#Maybe one day we'll be able to save up for a trip there.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.7": "It's really convenient living right next to the sea. My daily commute is literally a 5 minute walk down to the East Scarp beach.$1#$b#I guess yours is even shorter, huh?$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.8": "Do you ever notice birds following you around everywhere?$0#$b#Oh, no reason in particular. Forget I asked.$9#$e#%Dylan glances at the sky with a frown.",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.9": "Not now @, got another migraine. Really don't wanna talk. Sorry.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.10": "Why do I have migraines all the time? Well, all I have to go on are suspicions. I never got them as a kid.$2#$b#Dr. Harvey is at a loss as well. I don't think he'd believe me if I told him what I actually think. And neither would you.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.11": "I wish they'd just leave me alone. What did I do to deserve this? They won't ever shut up...$7#$b#...@? No, I don't mean you!$6#$b#It's nothing, I'm just thinking out loud. Don't eavesdrop.$5",

//About Family

"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.12": "Have you met my brother? I'll give you fair warning, he's a bit... out there to the uninitiated. But he's mostly harmless, unless you're a monster.$1#$b#He'll also talk your ear off given half a chance. If that's what you're after, I'm the wrong guy.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.13": "I live in East Scarp with Eli. It's a pretty nice neighbourhood, you should visit sometime.$1#$b#We're an eclectic crowd, but we don't bite. Well, most of us don't!$9#$b#And there's always interesting people showing up at Rosa's Inn. Should be well worth the journey for you.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.14": "Watch out if you're going to walk around East Scarp's beaches. It's fine during the day, but Rock Crabs are buried beneath the sand. They're an invasive species.$0#$b#They come out during the evening and are very aggressive. Eli's had to save people from them more than once.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.15": "I swear that Soot's made it his life's mission to mess with me.$8#$b#He barely acts up when Eli's around... but as soon as it's just us, the little pest is knocking stuff over, getting under my feet and causing chaos. Eli never believes it.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.16": "Can't stop, farmer. If I leave the house for too long that stupid little furball's going to wreck it.$0#$b#SOME people have a cat or dog in their house, but oh no. Not us.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.17": "Oh, hi there @! How's it going?$1#$b#Oh, cool. Me? Dreading coming home later. Eli somehow made our microwave catch fire this morning.$9#$e#But I feel like I can't complain because he does all of the cooking. I'm not very good at it.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.18": "Have you seen the way Eli sits on ledges and bridges all the time? He's always done that, probably thinks it makes him look cool.$0#$b#I won't judge you if you push him into the water one day. Trust me, I've done it before.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.19": "Did Eli tell you about how he ended up imposing Soot on us?$0#$b#He found him in the mines and came home clutching him to his chest, babbling about his 'adorable cuddly fuzzball'.$9#$b#Then he told me it's either this or the first Shadow Brute he finds. He was dead serious.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.20": "I worry about Eli, going to dangerous places like the mines all the time. Sometimes he comes back with nasty cuts.$2#$b#I know he can look after himself, but sometimes I swear he thinks he's invincible. He absolutely isn't.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.21": "Ended up having a big argument with Eli earlier.$0#$b#Oh, nothing bad. We were playing a multiplayer game and he gets really competitive.$1#$e#He's not a graceful loser. But I can hardly go easy on him just because he's my brother.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.22": "I did a deep clean of the house earlier. Except Eli's room, because he's a grown man and it's an absolute disaster scene in there.$9#$b#It's actually handy to have Soot around, since he feeds on dust. But if you tell Eli I said that, I'll deny it.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.23": "I bicker with Eli a lot, but it's just banter. We share a very close bond.$1#$b#He's always looked out for me, even when it was to his detriment. Maybe that's why I never really feel as comfortable around others?$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.24": "I don't think Soot is the only dust sprite in the area. I'm pretty sure I've heard them outside the house at night.$9#$b#I know it's not Soot because he sleeps in Eli's room. As if he'd let his pampered pest sleep outside...$0#$e#Do dust sprites have some sort of hierarchy? Soot had better not turn out to be a pack alpha.$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.25": "I almost tripped over Eli earlier. Sometimes he passes out from exhaustion before he can get to his bed and I find him on the floor the next day.$9#$b#He's got a lot of energy but even he has a limit. It doesn't help that he often struggles to sleep.$2",

//Friends & Neighbours

"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.26": "I bet Willy's already trying to rope you into fishing. I'm right, aren't I?$1#$b#Good luck with it if you do, but you're liable to catch trash that people dumped into the ocean. It's the same wherever you go.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.27": "Elliott and Leah are nice people. I don't go to the Saloon often but they always invite me to join them if Eli can't make it.$0#$b#I find their work intriguing. And they're always asking what we've been up to.$1#$b#'Are we friends'? Ha... that'd be nice. But if anything, they probably just pity me.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.28": "I might see if Willy's caught anything interesting later. He lets me check out his catch for my research.$3#$b#He's a decent guy. And he doesn't talk too much, which suits me.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.29": "When I saw Elliott earlier I swear I saw a live crab peeking out of his pocket. And not for the first time.$0#$b#He's got to know it's there, right? What's that all about?$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.30": "Elliott and Leah asked me if I'd join them for an evening at the Saloon later. They said that there's no pressure.$0#$b#I might actually take them up on that.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.31": "Aideen's a nice neighbour, even though she is a complete anachronism. She's just missing a horse drawn carriage and some servants.$0#$b#You'd better mind your manners, though. Eli got a savage tongue-lashing from her when he swore in her presence. She threatened to wash out that foul mouth of his.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.32": "Sometimes Elliott offers me refreshments when I work near his place and asks about my studies. He's a good listener.$0#$b#He's the sort of person who always knows the right thing to say when you need it. So is Leah, come to think of it.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.33": "We get our groceries from Pierre's. Not that we have much choice, since Eli got himself banned from the JojaMart.#$b#I bet Pierre would absolutely become the next Joja if he ever got the chance.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.0-4.34": "Willy was kind enough to bring me an angelfish the last time he went to the Fern Islands. It was just before you arrived, actually.$0#$b#I try not to play favourites among my pets, but she's probably tied with the octopus. Beautiful thing.$3",

It's not easy to leave behind everything you've ever known, is it?$0#$b#Their track record on pollution is terrible. I've seen sealed Joja Cola cans floating in the ocean too many times to count.$2#$e#And Eli's seen them in even stranger places... like lakes of magma, deep within the mines.$9",

Being so close to the sea, it wouldn't surprise me if there's at least one underwater cave system.$0#$b#I couldn't go cave diving though, no matter what kind of amazing ecosystem it might have.

"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.58": "Once the war is over, Eli and myself are going to plan a trip overseas to Gotoro. We've never been, but we always wanted to.$0#$b#In the meantime, there's still loads of places in Ferngill that we've yet to visit. Chestervale and Fort Josa look nice.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.59": "I THINK I caught a glimpse of a strange creature in the ocean this morning that I don't recognise! Greenish scales and a vaguely humanoid shape.$6#$b#I might've just been imagining things. I blame Eli for filling my head with talk of a 'friendly sea monster'. It's a prank, surely.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.60": "I keep having these weird, vivid dreams. Obviously they're fabrications of my mind, but they feel VERY real. I remember them perfectly.$9#$b#Emily thinks that they mean something. Normally I'd say she's full of it, but now I'm having doubts.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.61": "Eli's actually got a formal education in monster research, from before he went off to do his own thing.$0#$b#I'm hoping to earn a PhD in my field. I'm actively working on it, but there's still a long road ahead of me.$1#$b#It's been a fun road, though! I don't regret any of it.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.62": "I opened my dresser earlier, then Soot leaped out and almost gave me a heart attack. I don't know how he even got in there!$5#$b#That's not even the strangest place I've found him in. You don't want to know where.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.63": "I had this cool idea for a lure that mimics the bioluminescence of deep sea fauna. I wonder if I can get Maru to help me with it?$1#$b#It pays to be friends with a robotics genius. She's been helping me out so much with her technical prowess.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.64": "I don't think I'm ever going to be fully comfortable around people, but my anxiety is manageable these days.$0#$b#I've partly got you to thank for that, @. You were patient with me even after my less than stellar first impression.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.65": "Elliott showed me a peek of his latest story. It's very well written, but there's a lot of gratuitous romance in it.$0#$b#Eli will love it, at least.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.66": "I didn't think it was possible, but Rosa managed to beat my Junimo Kart high score. Again!$6#$b#We have an ongoing bet. Whenever she manages to beat my record, I have to taste test her new recipes. Still, as penalties go it's quite an enjoyable one.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.67": "Did you know that sailors used to mistake manatees and dugongs for Mermaids long ago? It happened often enough that their scientific name is Sirenia.$3#$b#Actual Mermaids are real, though! I've seen them for myself during the Night Market from the submarine, although we still know little about them. This is one myth that both me and Eli can agree on.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.68": "I watched Willy fish up the most enormous conger eel the other day! A female that must've been at LEAST three and a half meters!$3#$b#We needed help pulling her out of the water so I could take a good look. I think she might even be a record-breaking specimen.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.69": "They've gone and opened a Cthulhu Mythos exhibit at the Literature Museum over in Fort Josa, but I'm stuck in the Valley for the foreseeable future.$2#$b#I'll see if I can plan something with Eli, I know he'd love to go as well.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.70": "It's been quite a while since I last saw a real mess on the beach. Looks like our efforts are finally getting through to people!$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.71": "That mouse has been in my room again. It's a very strange little thing... it was living in our house before we got there.$9#$b#We've never seen it properly, either. But it seems harmless enough, so we leave it be.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.72": "It's a real pain, having to wait for feedback on a project I've submitted. It was more a work of passion, but I like to think my research was well documented.$0#$b#They really don't need to make me wait ages like this.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.73": "Dr. Jacob's animal husbandry knowledge is as impressive as you'd expect - we even had a productive conversation recently over saltwater aquariums.$1#$b#I didn't realise how familiar he was with the subject. It's good to know my tank's in capable hands if I'm out of town.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.74": "I wrote a lot of my final papers in a cafe back in Point Drake. I picked that shop in particular because they made Eli's favorite coffee roast.$0#$b#I'd always try to bring one home to him - but don't tell him that. He'd get all sappy if he knew.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.75": "I wish Eli could do something about our guest room. Or the so-called Wizard. It would be nice to have some extra space instead of... whatever that is.$2#$b#I hate walking past that door. I keep thinking it'll open and that I'll find something nasty on the other side. I haven't been able to clean it since the incident!$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.76": "I finally got round to adding a new SSD to my computer and it's made a world of difference already to my loading times.$3#$b#I'm not as knowledgeable on PCs as Sebastian, but I can probably help with yours in an emergency.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.77": "I woke up to Soot sitting inches from my face. I'm not sure who was more startled, but my reaction upset him and he covered my bed in coal dust.$2#$b#I don't even know how the little terror got in, I leave my door closed every night! I bet my brother is responsible.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.78": "The seagulls helped me out the other day when the wind blew my notes out of my hand - they actually brought them back for me!$6#$b#It's nice that they don't prank me as often these days, although their incessant talking still gives me a headache.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.79": "Emily came over to visit us and left with half of Eli's wardrobe. I don't know why she bothers repairing his clothes, he'll only wear them into the mines again.$9#$b#Still, she also offered to fix up a few of mine while she's at it. We don't deserve her, we really don't.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.80": "I got held hostage by Munchington yesterday when I was sitting at a bench. He sat on me and dug his claws in every time I tried to stop petting him.$1#$b#I was trapped there for two and a half hours before he got bored and left.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.81": "%Dylan is in the middle of yawning dramatically when you get his attention.#$b#Hi, @... I didn't get any sleep. But at least Eli slept well for a change. His snoring cut through the wall like a chainsaw and I'm all out of earplugs.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.82": "I wish Eli would buy his own soap instead of nicking mine all the time. The brand I like isn't exactly cheap at Pierre's.$2#$b#I would 'borrow' something of his in retaliation, but he's so disorganised that he probably won't notice.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.83": "Hi, @. You'll never believe this article they had the audacity to publish in a scientific newsletter I subscribe to! It was complete bull, have a look -!$7#$b#%Dylan launches into a lengthy, hard to follow tirade against the apparently abominable article that he's brandishing. Apparently someone didn't cite their sources!",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.84": "It's tempting to get a little hat for the tuxedo urchin in my aquarium. Did you know that they're covered in hundreds of tiny tube feet that they can grab objects with?$1#$b#Perhaps a hat will stop it from kidnapping my poor hermit crabs and parading them around. They always look so confused.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.85": "I've been getting into this new fantasy MMO called Realm of Rebellion. I didn't realise how addicting it is! Abigail, Sam and Sebastian play as well.$1#$b#It's a lot easier for me to be sociable with people when I'm hiding behind a monitor.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.86": "Hey, @. It's a nice day, isn't it?$0#$b#Unfortunately I can't stop to chat, though - I've got work to do. We'll catch up later, okay?$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.93": "...Can we talk later, please? I really don't feel good right now. Sorry @, it feels like my head's going to explode.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.94": "Huh? Oh, sorry @. I've got a lot on my mind. I think I'm making progress with my research and I'd like to keep up the momentum.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.95": "I've spent all week reading this new webcomic I found about a man who gets trapped in a fantasy world. Then I got to the end and promptly started re-reading it.$1#$b#I can't wait to see it update. I'm thoroughly invested in the characters, and the worldbuilding is phenomenal!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.96": "Eli asked me to take a look at his laptop because there were some... unsavoury popups appearing everywhere, and emails that're even worse.$9#$b#He was evasive when I asked what sites he'd been on for that to happen. He'd better not make me put parental controls on it.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.97": "I'm going to need to restock our first aid kit. Eli tried using all of our bandaids to hold a bandage in place when his arm got cut in the mines. They didn't hold.$7#$b#He was going to see Emily instead - anything to avoid seeing an actual doctor - but I made him go to the clinic anyway. He whined incessantly the entire time. So embarrassing!$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.98": "I looked up some of the people I used to go to school with. It's pretty interesting to see how much they've changed in the intervening years.$0#$b#Not that I ever had much to do with them in the first place. I only had a few friends back then... but that didn't matter, so long as I had Eli.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.99": "Thistle's a pain in the backside, but I can't deny that I'm very fond of her. When she realised that I understood her, she decided she was going to be my friend.$3#$b#She's abrasive and a thief to boot, but she's very sweet beneath it all. She loves to tease Eli in particular, but she looks out for him as much as she does for me.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.100": "Hey, @! Would you mind trying these for me? I tried my hand at baking for the first time in ages and... they're not too burned? I'm actually quite proud![223]$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.1": "Eli swears he saw a really unusual floor in the mines and some sort of squid, that it was somehow swimming through the air and dashed at him.$0#$b#I've heard of rock crabs in there, but not flying cephalopods. Still, it's not like he's one to exaggerate about this sort of thing...$9#$e#I wonder if he can bring me one. Preferably alive so I can make a proper study of it.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.2": "Cleaning out my aquarium is always an interesting experience. The octopus loves to try to steal whatever it is I'm holding.$3#$b#I've also got 16 species of coral in there and some of them can sting, so that's something else to watch out for.$0#$e#And I'm pretty certain I've got a mantis shrimp lurking in there somewhere. I sometimes hear clicking at night.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.3": "I've been trying to tidy up our garden, but I'm afraid that botany isn't really my thing. I might need to ask Aideen for tips - her garden is gorgeous.$0#$b#I suppose I could ask you as well, come to think of it. But don't let me detain you.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.4": "I sent off another grant application earlier - if it's accepted, I'll be researching the use of plankton as a fish food source in aquaculture.$1#$b#Not that it pays as well as I'd like. And only then if the research is viable. Still, it's something. And it'll hopefully help feed people on top of that.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.5": "The cleaner shrimp in my aquarium are such pigs at feeding time. I have to cover up the corals so that they don't get their food stolen from them!$1#$b#Wild cleaner shrimp will remove parasites from the mouths and bodies of client fish who wait patiently for their turn - even much larger predators. I love that sort of mutualism.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.6": "I'm working on my PhD, but it's slow going. The nearest university with facilities I could make use of is all the way over in Zuzu City.$2#$b#Still, there's no shortage of research opportunities for me here. And Demetrius is kind enough to lend me the things I need that I can't yet afford.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.7": "Joja isn't the only source of pollution around here, but they're definitely one of the largest. It may even affect the edibility of the fish in local waters.$2#$b#I've already submitted a report to the nearby fisheries and canneries. Naturally, they're not happy about it at all - but Joja is unlikely to listen to them.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.8": "*Sigh* Eli managed to drop one of our last best mugs and get coffee on my paperwork this morning. It's a good job that I didn't get very far.$2#$b#I can't get upset at him for long, though. He always looks like a kicked puppy, I had to calm him down and let him know I still love him.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.9": "Eli found a few shark teeth in one of the caves he started exploring. I need to compare them with those of known sharks, but I've never seen this species!$6#$b#They must be prehistoric. He's excited to know if they'll name this shark after him if my hunch is right. We'll see. I'll have to show Demetrius and Maru first.$1#$b#And we'd have to try and find the rest of it, of course.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.10": "Hello, @. I've just recovered from a particularly nasty migraine. I'm going to have to apologize to Eli for snapping at him when he kept trying to fuss over me.$2#$b#He means well, but you've heard how loud he is at the best of times - his default volume drowns out nearby jet engines. I hope he isn't upset with me.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.11": "Maru invited me out the other night to go stargazing with her. There's no light pollution here in the Valley, so you can see the night sky in all its glory.$1#$b#We ended up getting a great view of the Stardrop constellation! It makes you wonder. We've barely explored our own ocean, but there's stuff out there that we couldn't even imagine.$3#$b#Hopefully nothing like the incomprehensible beings from the cosmic horror stories I've been reading.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.12": "Hm? You want to know what the birds talk about? I know it must sound fascinating but believe me, most of it is very mundane.$0#$b#'Do you think she likes my plumage?' 'That food was mine! I saw the human drop it first!' 'My feathers are itchy!' You get the picture.$9#$b#I used to have to concentrate hard to understand them, but over the years it got easier. As natural as breathing.$0#$e#It was fun at first, knowing something that others don't. It's not so fun when you have to listen to it all day, every day.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.13": "I haven't shopped at Joja for a long time, but there's still no escape from the damn ad jingles that play on the TV and radio. Intrusive earworms.$7#$b#I can still hear them in my head. I hope it wasn't worse for you when you worked for them.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.14": "I might hop onto the MMORPG I've been playing later tonight. It's a nice way of meeting people - I've got guildmates from all over the world.$1#$b#I wonder if anyone else in the Valley plays it?$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.15": "Can you drive, @? I can, but we've never owned a car of our own. And honestly, I get really nervous behind the wheel - I find other drivers unpredictable.$9#$b#Eli can also drive, but I'm even more nervous when he's the one doing it. He thinks that speed limits are a polite suggestion. How he passed his test, I'll never know.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.16": "I ended up visiting the library while class was in session and the kids started grilling me for facts on sharks and how to avoid an attack.$0#$b#The vast majority of sharks have no interest in eating humans. When they DO bite, it's usually curiosity or because they mistook us for their natural prey.$1#$b#Then Vincent asked if you can stop a shark by punching it in the nose. Yes, their snout is very sensitive. No, I don't recommend testing it out.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.17": "Pierre tried charging me twice for something the other day. I had to point out that I'd already paid for it and he wanted to argue with me over it.$5#$b#I wish Eli had been there, I hate confrontations. Still, Pierre did apologize in the end. He even threw in an extra apple - you can have it.[613]$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.18": "I found a large hermit crab living inside a Joja cola can. I'm glad that it found a use for the can, but it still shouldn't have been there in the first place.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.19": "I feel like I'm going mad. I picked up this word from Thistle - some sort of swear word in her language? And I used it in front of Rosa when I stubbed my toe.$7#$b#I don't think she really noticed anything out of the ordinary, she was too busy running to clean up the food I'd dropped all over the Inn floor. But it's still embarrassing!$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.20": "Demetrius can be pretty condescending at times when talking to me. But I don't think it's mean spirited... he doesn't seem to know that he does it.$0#$b#I mentioned it to Eli and he said that I do the same thing. Oh, Yoba... it's true, isn't it? I don't do it on purpose, I swear!$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.1": "Hi @. I, uh, managed to fall off the pier. Thought I saw a new jellyfish species and leaned over the edge to take a look.$9#$b#It was actually a floating piece of plastic.$5#$b#Gotta go and get changed before Eli sees. He'd never let me live it down.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.2": "If you're into fishing, you might find a pufferfish if you're lucky! They're quite active at this time of year.$1#$b#Just don't ever try eating one. Tetrodotoxin poisoning is a nasty way to go.$9#$e#And watch your fingers, because they have a powerful bite.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.3": "Hey, @. Hope you've been sleeping better than I have.$0#$b#The heat's bad enough without Eli's snoring. They can probably hear him from the other side of town.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.4": "If you're growing peppers, Eli and me will probably buy some. We both enjoy spicy food.$3#$b#How's your new life in the countryside coming along, anyway? Hope it's turning out how you wanted.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.5": "A few days each Summer, the ocean water turns bright green. It's caused by phytoplankton blooms that coincide with the crab mating season.$1#$b#You'll find a lot of coral and interesting shells washed up on the beach during this time.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.6": "Hope you're keeping hydrated, @. Nobody wants to find you collapsed from heat exhaustion.$0#$b#Especially considering how active you are - you remind me of Eli in some ways. Seriously, do you ever rest?$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.7": "I got an angry phone call from Aideen telling me to extract Eli from her rose bushes - he'd somehow wandered there at an unholy hour and passed out.$2I wish he'd stay at home and just read or watch TV when his insomnia plays up. I worry about him going out in the dead of night.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.8": "I get that dust sprites hate the Summer heat, but that's no excuse for Soot to get into our fridge. He made it filthy and somehow devoured half our groceries!$7#$b#I cleaned the fridge out, but Eli's replacing our food. He probably left the door ajar yet again and that's how the little bugger got in.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.9": "Get out to the beach early enough and you can find wild octopuses at this time of year. Good luck catching one, though - even Willy has a tough time with them.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.10": "This new game came out recently called {{GameName}}. We just bought it, I'm looking forward to trying it with Eli later.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.11": "I saw a Crimsonfish recently at the eastern pier of the town's beach. They're a very rare find and a protected species!$3#$b#Most of the year they're found in the open ocean miles away from any shore, but during Summer they visit the shallows to spawn.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.12": "I'm not sure what's worse. The stench when Eli gets back from an adventure covered in mud and slime, or his new cologne.$9#$b#Is he trying to impress people or put them in a coma?$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.13": "I might pay the Inn a visit later. Thank goodness that Rosa's place has air conditioning.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.14": "I rarely go to Cindersap Forest, but Eli dragged me out for a walk there the other day. Marnie invited us in for fresh glasses of milk and we chatted for a while.$1#$b#It's small moments like that which make me realise how comfortable I'm getting with the people here. It's really quite nice.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.15": "I think I should try exercising more often. I go out pretty much all the time, but it's not quite the same. I'd rather not do it with a group, though.$9#$b#Maybe I should ask Eli or even Alex for advice... he's nice enough, but I don't really talk to him beyond exchanging pleasantries.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.16": "Would you mind signing this petition, @? It's a campaign to stop the captivity of orcas in the Ferngill Aquarium, which is no place for such large and intelligent Cetaceans.$0#$b#Thanks for that. Unfortunately these orcas can't be released into the wild, but we're hoping to rehome them in a sanctuary run by a colleage of mine instead.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.17": "Nice weather, isn't it? I think Rosa's planning another neighbourhood barbeque soon, and you can bet that I'll be in attendance.$3#$b#Rosa's cooking is always wonderful. She has this knack for knowing exactly how everybody likes theirs done.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.18": "If I'm not mistaken, the percula clownfish in my aquarium are getting ready to spawn soon! I'll need to prepare a small tank for the fry to live in.$3It's always a warm feeling when you realise that your pets are reproducing. It's how you know that you're doing a great job of keeping them happy.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.19": "I had a pretty rough day yesterday because of a splitting migraine. Soot stayed with me most of the time though - like he wanted to comfort me.$0#$b#He can be sweet when he wants to. I know I moan about his antics a lot, but he's not all bad, you know?$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.20": "I was going through our mail this morning and found one addressed to me. It was a... a love letter.

I'm pretty paranoid now!$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.1": "My brother insists on us obeying all sorts of superstitions during Fall. Salt on the threshold, avoid black cats on your path, that sort of thing.$0#$b#I don't really understand the occult, but Eli's an encyclopedia on it. Let's say I've experienced some really inexplicable things before.$9#$e#Spend enough time around him and you'll know what I mean. He's like a magnet for the bizarre.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.2": "Willy occasionally takes me out on his boat, but I wish I had one of my own.$0#$b#Actually, no. I wish I had a submarine like the one at the Night Market. It would be scary, but fun.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.3": "Sea cucumbers become common at this time of year. And their rarer cousin, the 'super cucumber', is active from Summer 'til the end of Fall.$1#$b#They're actually capable of liquifying their bodies to escape predators before becoming a solid again. No other animal can do that!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.4": "Fall's great for camping. We sometimes go into the mountains or on the beach for a nice evening out.$3#$b#Eli's got a massive collection of horror stories. They're definitely more atmospheric when told under the stars.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.5": "Do I relax with some games later or continue writing my paper on the dioecy of local Hydrozoan species?$0#$b#Who am I kidding? Stupid question. Junimo Kart can wait a little longer.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.6": "Are you into video games, @? Eli and I are both pretty avid gamers. I managed to get the last achievement in {{GameName}} yesterday!$1#$b#It was one of those really obnoxious ones as well, but it was so satisfying to finally hit 100% completion. I'll probably end up replaying it sooner or later.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.7": "I'm trying to devise a new puzzle for Penelope the Octopus. They're intelligent creatures that enjoy challenges, such as food in jars they need to unscrew.$3#$b#Unfortunately, she also employs that intelligence against me on a regular basis. They are master escape artists - keeping her in the aquarium is like a game between us both.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.8": "I've got to order more nitrate, pH and calcium test kits soon. When keeping a reef aquarium you have to keep a close eye on a lot of water parameters.$0#$b#It's a delicate balancing act, especially with smaller ones like my nano tank where fluctuations happen faster.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.9": "Eli commissioned a painting from Leah ages ago, but I only saw it once when he brought it home. I've no idea where he put it. I didn't think he was into art.$0#$b#Not that I'm fussed... it was oddly ominous to look at and nothing like Leah's usual subject matter. No offence to her, of course.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.10": "Eli and I had a discussion about aliens recently. We both think they're real - the chances of our planet being the only habitable one are simply too low.$1#$b#But I was thinking - if we're seeing the stars as they appeared millenia ago because it takes light so long to reach us, what does that mean for alien signals sent our way?$9#$b#Would those aliens even still be around by the time we heard their message? I think I gave Eli an existential crisis with that question.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.11": "Fall's a really cosy season, don't you think? Crisp, cool air and earlier evenings. It's particularly nice here in the Valley.$1#$b#Eli loves to break out the horror movies at this time of year.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.12": "Did you know that there's a rare anglerfish species that migrates upriver around this time of year? It's very unusual.$3#$b#Willy reckons he's seen one visit the town river, but he's failed to catch it. Good luck if you try.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.13": "Fall's always profitable for a farmer, right? We're looking forward to buying a pumpkin or two from you.$3#$b#I hope you're not overworking yourself, though. Your health should always come first.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.14": "It gets a bit nippy at this time of year on Willy's boat, but I take any opportunity I can to get out there when he offers to take me.$0#$b#We saw a pod of orcas last time that came remarkably close to us. Later I'll have to show you the photos I took.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.15": "@? This is really embarrassing, but Thistle brought this home and I've got a sneaking suspicion that she stole it from your farm.$9#$b#I'll have a word with her later, I know she's not my pet but I still sort of feel responsible. Sorry.[272 270 300 274 284 278 282 595 398 276 280]$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.16": "I heard something rummaging around outside our house last night when I was watching a movie with Eli. I asked him to check - I mean, he's the one with a sword.$2#$b#He said it was just a raccoon, but I'm not so sure. I know perfectly well that there's monsters around the Orchard not far from our house!$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.17": "*Sigh* We have an apocalypse drill scheduled later tonight. Eli's planned out exactly where we'll go and what we'll do in the event of a zombie outbreak.$9#$b#He takes this sort of thing very seriously. I'll go along with it, as long as he isn't allowed to get his hands on a firearm of any kind. Knowing him, he'd maim himself with it.$2#$b#Also, I'm not to tell you or anyone else where his 'safehouse' is, in case any of you snap and resort to banditry after the fact. Sorry, @.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.18": "Sometimes Eli and I play board games when we're not busy. Last night, it was chess. I thought I'd won, but he trapped me without me even realising.$6#$b#I don't think HE realised as well until I was in checkmate. I sometimes wonder if his goofiness is just a front he puts up.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.19": "Has Eli been acting differently towards you lately? Like, way more energetic and excitable than usual? Talking really fast? Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about.$0#$b#He gets like that sometimes. I don't know what the cause is, but it's not a new development.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.20": "I've never actually seen any of the cryptids that Eli chases, but he's convinced that they're real. And honestly, I can't prove that they DON'T exist.$0#$b#New species are discovered all the time though, so maybe there is some grain of truth to the Thresher Worms or Manticores said to live in Gotoro?",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.1": "Eli thought he'd get away with throwing a snowball at my face earlier. So I shoved one right down the front of his shirt. No regrets.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.2": "Any good at making snowmen? I'm not too bad at it myself.$0#$b#But you should see the abominations that Eli created last year. He had one big snowman being eaten alive by a horde of little zombie ones.$1#$e#Good job that Lewis doesn't visit East Scarp much. He would've lost it.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.3": "Hi @. Bet you'll be glad to get back into the warmth later.$0#$b#I should really invest in a warmer coat for when I'm working on the beach all day.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.4": "It was Winter when we moved to Pelican Town from Point Drake. I wonder if it's changed much since then?$0#$b#It was nice, but I don't miss it all that much now. The small town atmosphere suits me more.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.5": "I might end up visiting the Inn with Eli later. And by 'visit', I mean he'll drag me there because he thinks I 'work too hard'.$9#$b#Maybe he's right. Rosa and the others aren't bad... and the place is cosy.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.6": "If you're lucky, you might see squid at this time of year during the night.$0#$b#They're attracted to the light of places like piers, where they dart out of the shadows to snatch prey that swims by.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.7": "So what do you do to keep yourself occupied during Winter? You know, you could try your hand at aquaculture.$0#$b#Different fish can be rewarding to farm if you've got ponds to keep them happy in. I can give husbandry advice if you like.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.8": "There's a very rare fish called the Glacierfish that's only active at this time of year.$1#$b#It's only been sighted in Cindersap Forest, where it migrates upriver each year to lay eggs on the underside of glaciers. I don't think even Willy's caught one.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.9": "'Blobfish' get their moniker from their bloated appearance, but this is caused by rapid depressurisation when removed from their deep sea habitat.$2#$b#Surprisingly, the specimens caught around here are able to survive it. How they do so is currently a mystery to me. It shouldn't be possible...$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.10": "The hardest part about Winter is getting out of bed each day. I wish I could enjoy the warmth a little longer.$0#$b#Actually, no. The hardest part is getting ambushed by Eli for a surprise snowball fight. Watch yourself, @. He'll get you when you least expect it.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.11": "I've got to be more careful. I managed to slip on a patch of ice in front of people earlier, it was so embarrassing!$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.12": "Why is it that whenever this time of year comes round, they always play the exact same festive songs over and over?$0#$b#Surely someone out there is writing new ones, right? The classics get grating after a while when it's all you hear.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.13": "Eloise stopped by to compliment the snow goons earlier. I'm glad she sees the humour in them.$1#$b#Eli tries to outdo himself with them every year. We used to get complaints, but people seem used to it by now.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.14": "I almost dozed off earlier while sitting by the window and watching the snow fall over the Scarp. It's incredibly relaxing, isn't it?$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.15": "I kept Gunther past closing time the other evening. I'd like to say it was because I was engrossed in a new book, but I was just putting off going back out.$0#$b#Hopefully he'll forgive me for wanting to stay warm and dry at this time of year.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.16": "What a day... I had to dunk my arm into freezing seawater to retrieve my notes after dropping them. And then I got home to find that Eli had finished off our cocoa.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.17": "I worry about Thistle getting cold at this time of the year. I know that crows are used to it, but still.$0#$b#She said she's good and she'll nick a scarf from someone if she has to. Not on my watch she isn't.$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.18": "One of these years, I'm going to spend Winter in a warmer climate. I'm tired of making a spectacle of myself every time I go into town and slip on ice.$2#$b#I don't want to have to visit Harvey more than my annual checkup, thank you very much.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.19": "I think Eli wants to bring home one of those ridiculously massive pizzas that Gus makes for our dinner tonight. I can't think of a better way to warm up right now.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.20": "Pelican Town always looks gorgeous under a blanket of fresh snow during the Winter. It's very picturesque.$1#$b#It reminds me of the little model village houses that I used to see in shops at Point Drake during Winter Star sales.$3",

/*DYLAN NPC COMMENTARY
#BEARFAM
SIGURD/SONDRA*/

"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.1": "Sig once snatched a gull out of the air when it stole my notes on the beach. I'd never seen anything like it! That was surprisingly nice of him.$6#$b#The gulls were less impressed. You should hear the obscenities they scream when they see him these days.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.2": "The Bears are good neighbours. I don't talk to Sergeant Bear that often and he looks rough, but he's alright. Well, until he starts making those vulgar jokes.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.3": "I often see Sig loitering on the beach while I'm working. I expect him to throw his cigarette ends or Joja cola cans on the ground, but luckily he never does.$0#$b#He probably knows that Gudrun would lay into him if she found out.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.4": "I saw Sig thoroughly engrossed in poetry at the library. I didn't think he was the sort to appreciate that kind of thing, but he seems to be an enthusiast.$0#$b#Goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, doesn't it?$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.5": "I was checking my phone while walking back home and walked right into Sergeant Bear. I don't know how I failed to spot that blue haired... continental landmass.$7#$b#He just smirked at me and asked if I was alright after helping me up, but I was too embarrassed to say anything. It's going to be awkward next time I see him.$2",

"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.1": "Having Sondra around is very much what I imagine having an aunt would be like. She dotes on practically everyone around here, not just her family.$1#$b#I'm still not used to it at all.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.2": "While I was working outdoors, Sondra stopped by with a packed lunch. She was worried that I'd forgotten to eat... it happens sometimes when I'm engrossed in what I'm doing.$1#$b#She seemed to know exactly what my favourite foods are. I don't remember telling her. I wonder if somebody else did?$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.3": "I think Eli's plotting to rope Sondra into helping us dodge taxes. I'll have to stop him before she agrees to do it out of the kindness of her heart.$7#$b#We have enough problems without FRS agents rappelling through our windows in the dead of night.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.4": "I ended up watching three full episodes of Zuzu M.D. with Sondra at the Bear Lodge yesterday, followed by her insisting that I let her treat me to a homecooked dinner.$1#$b#I only popped round to return the game I borrowed from Gunnar last week! I ended up coming home much later than planned, but I can't possibly complain. The Bears take hospitality seriously.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.5": "Sondra insisted that I jump ahead of her while queuing at Pierre's, but that seemed wrong, so I told her that she should go first instead. She's older, after all.$0#$b#Followed by us having a back and forth about it until Pierre finally cleared his throat. Sondra won.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.1": "I find myself apologising to Gunnar whenever he duels against my brother - I think Eli is a tad too overenthusiastic.$0#$b#Poor guy ends up on the ground more often than not. I'll have to have another word with Eli about it.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.2": "Gudrun is remarkably clever for her age. I'm usually a bit impatient around younger people, but she's great at following what I talk about.$1#$b#If she doesn't get arrested for ecoterrorism, I think she would have promise as a scientist.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.3": "I think Gunnar wants me to come over for a game night once I'm done with my work. We've mostly been playing versus, but we've been trying coop lately.$3#$b#He's got the newer, fancy consoles as well. And unlike Eli, he doesn't start whining when he loses.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.4": "Eli thinks that I've been spending too much time talking to Gudrun. He claims that her juvenile speech patterns are starting to rub off on me.$7#$b#Like, excuse me? What does he know? That's, like, totally not true at all!$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.5": "My GPU ended up dying on me, so I had to call off the raid I'd planned with Gunnar. It sucked, but I figured that would be the end of it.$0#$b#And then I find out that he ordered a top end replacement that's superior in every way to the one I had. Just casually handed it to me. I'm still in shock!$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.6": "Gudrun sometimes accompanies me while I'm working. I don't mind, since she shares my passion for what I do and makes herself useful.$1#$b#She even asks to borrow my notes so she can learn more. If only more people were as inquisitive.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.7": "Gunnar was telling me about the last time he went into the mines on his own. I don't know how those adventurer types can bring themselves to do it!$9#$b#I know that Dr. Harvey worries himself sick over them. But hey, it keeps him in business.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.8": "Gudrun was round our place while I was cleaning the aquarium, talking my ear off about that Navigator Lune show. Got to admit, it all went over my head.$0#$b#Eli teased her for her taste in TV and got shut down so hard that he was too embarrassed to say much for the rest of the visit. Serves him right.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.9": "We went over to the Bear Lodge last night to watch Beware the Mothman with Gunnar. It's more Eli's thing, but it's an interesting series.$1#$b#I still can't get over the size of that fancy TV they've got! I dread to imagine how much it cost, let alone the ultimate streaming package they pay for.$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.10": "Did you know that Gudrun runs a blog about fish facts? She's really shown her work. I've contributed here and there for the sake of scientific accuracy.$3#$b#She also bullies big corporations on social media. I kind of feel sorry for the underpaid interns who have to deal with her shenanigans.$3",

"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.1": "If it weren't for the dogtags, I'd have a hard time remembering that Teren was a soldier. I picture them more like Sig, you know? Not as outwardly friendly.$0#$b#I was a little wary of him at first, but he's hard not to like.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.2": "Eli seems to get on well with Teren. Granted, that's a low bar - he gets along with anyone who's not an ass. But they hang out quite a lot.$1#$b#Hopefully he won't rope the poor guy into any trouble.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.3": "Teren's got rather good taste in video games. He's not a bad opponent either as it happens... he usually teams up with Eli or Sig, but that won't save any of them.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.4": "Teren was talking to me earlier and somehow we ended up on the subject of his poor luck with dating apps. He was asking if I... have ever had a partner.$0#$b#I've had people show interest in me before, but I've never felt those sort of emotions towards anyone. Well, not yet anyway. Sounds like a hassle, though.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.5": "Teren seemed to be very taken with my aquarium when he last visited. It's always nice when people take the time to appreciate the work I put into it.$1#$b#He's an animal lover, too. Next time I decide to add a fish to it, I might let him choose the species.$3",

//RODNEY

"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.1": "I just had to fish up yet another autographed photo of Rodney. There's no end to the damn things! And Eli's even found them in the ground!$5#$b#*Sigh* As neighbours go he's not bad at all, but apparently his ego is big enough to have its own gravitational field. I'll have a word with him.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.2": "I ended up getting accompanied by Rodney when I was working on the beach. He's always kind to me, so it was a welcome distraction.$0#$b#We wound up talking about his latest novel and by the end of it, I'd completely forgotten to collect any samples.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.3": "On my way back home yesterday, I glanced up at the silo window and caught a glimpse of Rodneys's silhouette. I... don't think he was wearing anything at all?$6#$b#That's going to make the next book club meeting at the library extremely awkward...$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.4": "I had to tell off Thistle again for pranking Rodney. She thinks it's funny to try and drop things on his head from the sky.$7#$b#So far she's only been successful a few times, but it's just a matter of time before she gets the other crows to copy her.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.5": "Rodney wants to read one of his books at our next Saturday night campfire. I don't think it's what Eli had in mind, but some variety might make it more fun.$0#$b#Rodney's stories are definitely more kid friendly than Eli's. Less likely to give you nightmares.$3",

//SEN

"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.1": "I've never seen this Sen character who Eli's friends with, but apparently he's the one who rummages through our trash at night. And he's not human.$0#$b#I thought the Shadow People are supposed to live far away from people. He sounds nice, though.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.2": "I found a little apology note left on our trashcan when I went to empty it. It was addressed to me... the sender said they accidentally knocked over the trash last night.$9#$b#Eli thinks that Sen wrote it. I've left my own note for him, saying it's okay and thanking him for cleaning up his mess. I wonder if he'll respond?$0#$action AddMail Current DylanSenNote received",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.3": "Eli asked me if there's any books I don't mind lending to Sen. I think there's some fantasy and sci-fi books somewhere that he can take a look at.$0#$b#Maybe I should slip a few of my marine biology books in there as well.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.4": "I heard something moving around outside the house in the early hours and peeked out of my window just in time to see a dark figure with horns making a run for it!$6#$b#Eli thinks it's nothing to worry about, but what if they were some sort of murderous maniac trying to break in? I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.5": "Eli sometimes goes out on late night excursions to meet those Shadow People. If we still had a guest room, he'd probably be trying to bring them home with him.$9",

//MATEO

"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.1": "I wasn't sure what to make of Mateo when I first met them. Seemed like your typical rough adventurer type. Then I actually spoke to them and realised...$9#$b#They're a MASSIVE nerd. One of the biggest nerds I've ever met and that's coming from me. They're an excellent DM!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.2": "It's a good job that Mateo has first aid certification, because it's not uncommon for them and Eli to stagger out of the mine together covered in cuts and scrapes.$2#$b#I'd still prefer that he went to Dr. Harvey for treatment, but you won't get him in that clinic unless you literally drag him kicking and screaming.$9#$b#I speak from experience... I needed Mateo's assistance to do it once.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.3": "Mateo is well known for their hatred of crabs. Not just the invasive rock crabs that attack people - crabs of all species. What a weird hangup.$9#$b#Maybe they got their toe pinched as a kid or something? Either way, I'd better not catch them hurting any.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.4": "I caught Eli trying to throw knives IN THE HOUSE! He told me that Dr. Luis showed him a trick and he wanted to learn it for himself.$5#$b#I don't believe him sometimes! Clearly I need to have another word with Mateo - I don't think they realize how impressionable my brother is. He'll be trying to JUGGLE them next.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.5": "I know it's not Dr. Luis's field of study, but I've heard great thing about the marine biology courses available at the university they went to.$0#$b#If there'd been an exchange student opportunity, I would've taken it in a heartbeat.$1#$b#I might've even seen them on campus then!$3",

//NORA

"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.1": "Nora's going to be coming over later to watch a documentary on the Fern Island marine iguanas with me. It should be interesting to the both of us.$0#$b#Eli's hopefully going to pick up one of those XL pizzas that Gus makes, I can hardly wait!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.2": "I might have to pay Nora a visit soon. Partly to catch up, but mostly so I have a pretext to lavish attention on Pinkie Pie and Stupid for a while.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.3": "I actually considered pursuing herpetology before I was serious about marine biology. In another timeline, Nora might've been my colleague.$1#$b#But if you tell her that, I'll deny it. I don't need her trying to convert me.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.4": "Has Eli said anything to you about Pepper Rexes lately? Because I've got the sneaking suspicion that he wants to capture one for Nora to study.$2#$b#Do I really have to remind people that this town is very flammable?$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.5": "Sorry @, I've got a migraine flaring up at the moment. Spending too much time in the company of Eli and Nora at the same time will do that to me.$7#$b#Neither of them have an indoor voice. I swear you can hear them from the other side of town sometimes!$9",

//GINGER ISLAND

"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Entering": "I can hear the parrots welcoming us to the island. They enjoy having new visitors around. Looks like a wonderful day for it!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort": "We're very lucky to be able to visit this place. The parrots told me that they set up the resort to reward your generosity. Good on you!$3#$b#Before Ginger Island became accessible to us, I can't remember the last time Eli and I could go on vacation. We're going to cherish it.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Leaving": "I had a lovely time, but I don't want to miss the boat home. I've got plenty to do later, what with going through the notes I wrote during my stay.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Shore": "Goodness, I'm having a field day. I know I'm supposed to be relaxing, but I can't NOT take the opportunity to examine the sea life here!$1#$b#If only I had some snorkelling equipment, I'd be checking out the nearby reefs. Still, I'm having a great time.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander": "The parrots endemic to this island are fascinating. They're not really used to human contact, but they're keen to learn about us and share their stories.$1#$b#Apparently that boy... Leo? They said he spent most of his life alone with them. And that he understands their speech. I hope the sight of other humans isn't alarming to him.$0#$b#Maybe I should try getting to know the kid. After all, I share a few things in common with him.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander_2": "I know it's inevitable, but Eli had better be careful when he decides to go into that volcano. There are no medical facilities on this island.$0#$b#Unfortunately, I can't tell him to relax on the beach without sounding like a hypocrite. But the work I've been undertaking here is decidedly less lethal.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander_3": "I had a chat with that curious bird trader further north. They barter in exchange for a random assortment of items found around here.$1#$b#I don't know what a 'Galaxy Soul' is, but they wanted 10 radioactive bars for it. I declined because I don't carry fissile material on my person.$0#$b#Yoba knows what they want it for, but I can't let Eli find out. I don't need him trying to find some in exchange for whatever that thing is.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Chair": "This is the life! I'm probably going to shut my eyes for a bit and take a nap in the sunshine to the gentle lapping of the waves. It's so tranquil here.$3#$b#I never seem to get migraines while I'm here. All the more incentive to visit more often.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Bar": "I'm just taking a moment to enjoy a drink before I continue collecting samples from the shore. Gus has done an excellent job with this bar.$3#$b#I hope you're remembering to stay hydrated, @. I bought extra sunscreen in case you want to borrow some.$1",

//MISC.

"Core.NovaDylan.DumpsterDiveComment": "Good to see that you take recycling seriously. Might as well take it if they're going to throw it away, right?$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.HitBySlingshot.2": "*Sigh* It's like I'm stuck at school all over again.$7",

"Core.NovaDylan.HitBySlingshot.4": "I wouldn't let my brother catch you doing that to me if I were you.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.HitBySlingshot.5": "These clothes have just been ironed, you moron!$6",

"Core.NovaDylan.RejectMovieTicket_AlreadyInvitedBySomeoneElse": "Oh! Sorry @, but I've got a prior engagement with someone else to the movie theatre later.$1#$b#I'm not used to being this in demand.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.RejectMovieTicket_AlreadyWatchedThisWeek": "I'm afraid I'll have to turn you down, I went this week already. It doesn't feel as special if I go too often, you know?$0",

"Core.NovaDylan.divorced_once": "I heard about your marriage breaking up. I'm not very good at comforting people, but I'm always here if you need to vent.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.divorced_twice": "I'm sorry to hear that your second marriage didn't work out... do you want to talk about it, @?$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.fishCaught_159": "Oh hey, Willy told me that you caught a crimsonfish! I'm impressed. They are extremely strong for their size.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.GreenRain": "Yes, I'm aware that we are experiencing anomalous weather today. Yes, I know pretty much everyone else except my brother refuses to go out in it.$0#$b#I have work to do! As long as it doesn't stain my clothes, I'm not bothered. Besides, I'm interested to see what effect it has on the sea life, if any.$9#$b#I don't even want to know what it's been doing to the guest room.$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.GreenRain2": "Ugh, I'm not looking forward to washing my clothes. Do you know how hard it is to scrub moss out of them? And that idiot Eli insists on staying out there!$2#$b#He can wash his own clothes this time.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.GreenRainFinished": "The effects the green rain had on the marine wildlife seem to range from non-existent to outright beneficial.$0#$b#I've noticed an increased amount of Zooxanthellae in the tissue of the coral samples I took, which allows them to grow faster. It makes them more vibrant, too!$3#$b#The downside is that there appears to be some form of algae or moss growing on the clothes I was wearing...$9",

//GIFT RESPONSES

"Gifts.NovaDylan.GiftReaction.Love": "Oh, wow. You've just made my day, @! Thank you so much.",

"Gifts.NovaDylan.GiftReaction.SuperCucumber.WinterStar": "What have we here, @? Oh, a super cucumber! That's certainly a fascinating present. Thank you!$3#$b#Normally I'd advise against bringing live sea life out into the snow like this, but super cucumbers come from very cold waters. Happy Winter Star!$1",
"Gifts.NovaDylan.GiftReaction.OceanStone.WinterStar": "Happy Winter Star, @! Oh, you have something for me? How nice.$1#$b#What a beautiful stone! I'm not really into geology, but I always liked ocean stones in particular. No, I'm not biased.$3",

"Gifts.NovaDylan.GiftReaction.RainbowShell": "Lovely colours on this shell! I've seen hermit crabs living in ones very much like it.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.FlowerDanceDialogue": "Hi @. Welcome to flower hell. I'd rather be literally anywhere else right now.$2#$b#I did think about faking a migraine to get out of this... but I'm getting there for real.$7",

"Core.NovaDylan.LuauDialogue": "Enjoying yourself? The food here is really good!$3#$b#I'd prefer to be working but I guess I can take it easy just for once. The water's great.$1#$b#I've also got my eye on Eli. I don't think he'd dare put anything dodgy in the soup, but you never know with him.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.LuauDialogue.Y2": "I'm tempted to try getting some work done, but Eli keeps telling me to relax and enjoy the festival. I suppose he does have a point.$1#$b#I'm pretty sure he's the reason Emily tried getting me to dance with her earlier. I'll pay him back for that later...$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.MoonlightJelliesDialogue": "The Lunaloos are fascinating. All jellyfish can detect light but these ones have a strange affinity for it. They'll come over once the candle-boat is sent out.$3#$b#Jellyfish don't have a central nervous system either, they're no more intelligent than a plant. But the Lunaloos seem almost aware of us.$1#$b#Wait... can you hear that...? Sounds almost like faint voices from the ocean. ...You don't hear them? Am I losing it, @?$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.MoonlightJelliesDialogue.Y2": "Look at all those people trying to get front row views by the water's edge. We're so lucky to have this ship!$3#$b#Eli reckons he saw some sort of aquatic cryptid nearby, but it was probably just a large eel.$1#$b#Personally, I'm hoping to get a better look at the rare green subspecies of Lunaloo that I saw last year. Not much is known about them at the moment.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.FairDialogue": "Marnie and Shane take wonderful care of these animals. He was telling me all about the work he does with them earlier.$1#$b#I can tell that the chickens absolutely adore him. Especially that one over there. Charlie, I think she's called.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.FairDialogue.Y2": "I'm not sure how much there is to this fortune telling business.

"Core.NovaDylan.Spirit'sEveDialogue.Y2": "This maze is pretty impressive, don't you think? Somebody put a lot of work into all of these practical effects.$0#$b#I'm not sure why people are afraid, though. Perhaps a lifetime of living with Eli and his horror movies has jaded me.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.IceFestivalDialogue": "Hey, @! Have you seen some of these ice sculptures? The people here are insanely talented. Good luck if you're going fishing later.$3#$b#Also if you're looking for Eli, he's on guard further out. I bought him some coffee earlier.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.IceFestivalDialogue.Y2": "The sculptures are so ephemeral, but Leah says it's part of the appeal of making them. There's a sense of urgency to admire them before they melt.$1#$b#I won't lie though, I'm looking forward to getting back indoors later! I like this festival, but I also like being able to feel my nose..$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.WinterStarDialogue.Opening": "Happy Winter Star, @! I know it's not much, but I got you a present.$1#$b#",

"Movies.NovaEli.ZuzuCityExpress.2": "Eli is trying unsuccessfully to look as though he isn't emotionally invested in the story.",
"Movies.NovaEli.ZuzuCityExpress.3": "Aww, come on! That was a huge cliffhanger. Did they even hit it off? Where's the juicy drama and snogging I was promised??$2",

Rasmodius laughed in my face when I asked him for help, but you know what they say- if you want something done properly, you've got to do it yourself. I don't mind how long it takes or how many moldering old tomes I need to look through! I suspect that the Shadow Folk originated in that impossible place - perhaps they still dwell there.^^I'm aware that this undertaking carries a huge risk. Is the Void even survivable? Will the very sight of the other side make me go insane? Will our house still be standing? Let's find out!#Have I mentioned that I have very little experience with this? The weird things that I can do are a part of me. Materialising out of thin air in the blink of an eye feels as natural as walking. But actually researching incantations and trying to prepare a ritual is a different beast altogether. I'm no real sorcerer. I have no wizardly qualifications.^^WHAT AM I DOING?#Alright, experiment number one: I've been designing a new warp totem and just finished carving the prototype. I've got to admit, it gives me the heebies. I substituted most of the hardwood for monster bone and also added some void essence (ethically sourced!) and iridium ore (a pain to get hold of). The idea is to use this thing as a sort of focus for the portal.^^Fingers crossed!",
"Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.2": "Eli's Notes, Part 2:^^The warp totem experiment went pear shaped. When I began the spells, the totem started to resonate and I could feel the atmosphere in the room starting to change. Unfortunately, the totem burned out and fell apart after a minute even as the air around it shimmered and distorted.^I definitely felt something happening. I suddenly felt cold and... empty? It's the middle of Summer but my breath was coming out as mist. And I also somehow felt stronger.^^I'm clearly on the right track!#I was reading that art can be a good catalyst for magic. Trouble is, I'm not much of an artist and neither is Dylan. If I could get a decent painting of the Void, using special pigments made from certain ingredients, I might be able to use that in combination with the warp totem! But what does the Void even look like? All I know is that it's mostly empty. Would this painting HAVE to be accurate?^^Leah waved to me when I took a walk past her cabin in the forest this morning. I wonder how much she charges for commissions?^^This could work out nicely!",
"Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.3": "Eli's Notes, Part 3:^^I think we're just about ready! Leah did an amazing job with that painting. She made this dark, otherworldly vista dotted by islands and waterfalls floating in the nothingness. It's actually rather beautiful- I hope the real Void looks something like that. Of course, I didn't tell her what I need the painting for.^^Hopefully I'll still be able to hang it on a wall somewhere once this little project is all said and done. I also made a new warp totem, hopefully a bit stronger than the last one.#I've double, triple and quadrupal checked everything. If I don't screw up, the painting will form a small, stable portal to another dimension. If not... oh, who am I kidding?^^Nothing will go wrong. I'm looking forward to telling Dylan and old Rasmodius all about my success later!#(The following was written in a hurry. You can barely make it out.)^^It worked, but not how it should've. The painting opened and I finally saw the Void. What I saw defies description. Everything I thought I knew about the world has been turned on its head. But the portal is too unstable and threatens to spill out into the house and East Scarp. I'm both extremely happy and terrified! Rasmodius knows what's going on, he teleported into the room and got to work. He looks PISSED.^^Now he's shouting at me to get out immediately so he can seal the room off and put wards on the door. And he also said to take nothing out of the room- not even you, Journal.^^I'm sorry.",
"Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.GreenRain": "Eli's Notes^^Holy shit. It's been a long time since my little experiment caused this room to be subsumed by the Void, but today, something else has taken over. Whatever this green rain is, it seems to be muting the Void's influence here. I can feel it for myself... it's absolutely there, but the plants - there are bloody TREES growing in my house - have overrun everything!^^My theory is that the green rain has some sort of purifying effect, that it somehow re-anchored the guest room back into reality. I don't know how long it'll last, so I'm writing as fast as I can. I need to get out in that rain and see what's happening!#What'll happen when the rain ends, though? Will the room leave again? What'll happen to those plants when they reach the Void? Will they die there, or proliferate and turn the timeless black abyss into a lush, otherworldly jungle?^^Arghh, why did I have to screw up that ritual?! I could find answers to these questions if I could get back to the other side, I know it!^^I'm heading out to experience the green rain for myself. Eli signing off!",

It wasn't his fault, but it made the mother of all messes... which I had to help clear up.$3#$b#Worth it to see Morris squashed under those shelves. But he didn't find it funny and banned Eli from the store. What an ass.$2",
"EliLateHangout": "Don't make a habit of passing out in the forest, yeah? I had to listen to Eli's chattering the whole time we were hauling you back to the farm.$3#$b#He was going on and on about mothmen and jabberwocks. And asking if I'd seen any UFOs lately.$2",

"CT.Shane.DylanSaloon": "Watching Dylan outdrink me wasn't on my bingo card this year. Never knew he had it in him.$0#$b#I bet he's already regretting it, though.$3",

"CT.Shane.EnDJojaBreak": "Man, watching Dylan put Morris in his place earlier was really something. You've gotta watch out for the quiet ones.$0",

//CLINT

"CT.Clint.EliSaloon": "I haven't got a chance, have I? I'm just not interesting enough for her...$2#$b#%Clint lets out a heavy sigh.",
"CT.Clint.EliGuild": "I got cornered by monsters in the mines the other day and barely made it out unharmed. Luckily Eli managed to retrieve all of my mining equipment.$0#$b#With that said, Marlon's fees have set me back a bit. I'd appreciate any work you threw my way.$2",

"CT.Clint.DylanSaloon": "I knew that Elliott and Leah go overboard sometimes, but Dylan too? The guy who barely talks to anyone?$0#$b#I had to leave when they got too rowdy.$3",

//GUS

"CT.Gus.EliSaloon": "I'm not sure if I believe half the stories Eli comes out with when he visits, but he's always been a gregarious sort.$1#$b#He's really interested in local folklore. He occasionally brings Dylan with him, but I still don't know a lot about them.$0#$b#Neither of them like to talk much about their past.$2",

"CT.Gus.DylanSaloon": "That was certainly an interesting evening, wouldn't you say, @? I'm glad that Dylan enjoyed himself, though.$0#$b#Eli tracked slime all over my floor, but at least he came back to help clean it up.$1",

//WIZARD

"CT.Wizard.EliWoods": "I gather that you saw some interesting things in the woods recently. Don't be so surprised - little in the Valley is hidden from one such as I.$0#$b#Eli's magic is curious, I must admit. Occasionally, mortals are born with a natural affinity for it that develops during adolescence if not sooner.$0#$b#But those attuned to the Void behind the world are a rare breed. Ironic given his sunny disposition.$0",

//ROBIN

"CT.Robin.DylanDroneProgress": "I'm not quite sure what Maru's building in her room this time, but the sound's been keeping me awake for the last few nights.$2#$b#I'm just glad that I had the foresight to fireproof our house.$0",

//DEMETRIUS

"CT.Demetrius.EliMushroomCave": "Hello, @! Eli brought me some fungal samples from the cave system that you two discovered.$0#$b#Several are species I can't find in any publications or databases, and a few may belong to an entirely new genus!$1#$b#I'm going to take Maru on a field expedition there soon. We're excited to catalogue the new ecosystem!$0",

"CT.Demetrius.DylanIntro": "Have you met Dylan? He's a marine biologist living in East Scarp. It's a rather respectable field.$1#$b#It's always nice to see younger people taking a serious interest in scientific pursuits. And he certainly knows his stuff!$0#$b#I bet I could still teach him a thing or two, though.$1",
"CT.Demetrius.DylanBeach": "Thank you for helping Dylan clean up the beach, @. We've always had a certain amount of pollution, but it's gotten worse since Joja came into town.$0#$b#I worry about the deleterious effects it's having on the local ecosystem. Something needs to be done about it.$2",
"CT.Demetrius.DylanDroneProgress": "Not long until our underwater adventure, huh? I've never seen Dylan so talkative lately!$1#$b#I have to remind Maru to take breaks, though. She's barely stopped since she got hold of those components you delivered.$0",
"CT.Demetrius.DylanExpedition": "Hello, @! I had the time of my life earlier. I've always wanted the chance to take part in that sort of marine biology venture.$1",
"CT.Demetrius.EnDPlan": "I'm actually really proud of the environmental report we compiled for Lewis. I'm hoping we can actually get it publicized pretty soon!$1",

//MARU

"CT.Maru.EliIntro": "Oh, you met Eli? He's certainly something, isn't he?$1#$b#He's a cryptozoologist, but I don't believe in that sort of pseudoscience. He's definitely knowledgeable on real monsters though.$0",
"CT.Maru.EliMushroomCave": "I had to help Harvey treat Eli earlier when he came back from that trip with you.$2#$b#He's fine, despite acting like a cornered animal when he came to the clinic.$0#$b#He made a run for it as soon as Harvey asked him about booking a follow up appointment!$1#$b#Dad's really excited about the fungal ecosystem you guys found. We're going to take a look for ourselves soon.$3",

"CT.Maru.DylanIntro": "It's exciting to have a marine biologist living in Pelican Town! I think Dylan might actually know more about the local marine ecosystem than Dad.$1#$b#He's always been withdrawn, though. He's obviously passionate about his field of expertise, but he doesn't seem to like engaging with people.$2",
"CT.Maru.DylanDroneProgress": "Hey, @! It won't be long until I'm done with the ROV. There's just a few last minute bugs to iron out in the software.$0#$b#I wonder if I forgot to put a comma or bracket somewhere...?$2",
"CT.Maru.DylanExpedition": "I won't lie to you, I had some doubts that my ROV design would be able to get as far as it did. But it exceeded all of my expectations!$1#$b#I should give the little guy a name, don't you think?$0",

"CT.Maru.EnDClinicAppointment": "Eli got dragged to the clinic earlier by Dylan and... well, it wasn't easy for any of us. But he actually toughed it out.$1#$b#I gave him a hug before he went. I think he needed it.$0",
"CT.Maru.EnDPlan": "I'm hopeful that Lewis is going to take our report to heart. At first I was nervous that he'd dismiss it, but he was a lot more patient than I expected.$0",

//Leah

"CT.Leah.EliIntro": "Oh, Eli was on a roof again? I thought I heard Lewis yelling at him earlier.$2#$b#People criticise him for being unconventional, but it's like water off a duck's back to him. I can respect that.$7#$b#Plus he appreciates my art. He commissioned me once when I really needed the cash.$1",
"CT.Leah.EliJunimo1": "Eli asked me if I believe in magic. In things like Junimos and ghosts.$0#$b#I try to keep an open mind about these topics, but I haven't personally seen any evidence for it.$2#$b#Who knows? Maybe some people have a different way of seeing the world that lets them perceive things the rest of us can't.$7#$b#I mean, as an artist I try to view the world through a different lens as well. It's an interesting thought, right?$1",
"CT.Leah.EliGuestRoom": "Sometimes I still think about that painting Eli commissioned me to do. The style and the subject matter... it's definitely not what I'm used to.$2#$b#I've been over to their place a few times since and I never saw it. He always gets evasive when I ask.$7#$b#He better not have trashed it by accident!$5",

"CT.Leah.DylanIntro": "Dylan's a bit mysterious, isn't he? I see him quite often when I go to the beach to make sketches.$0#$b#I try to make small talk with him while he's scribbling in his notebook, but it's hard to tell if he's actually listening. He's in his own little world.$2",
"CT.Leah.DylanBeach": "The beach looks a lot nicer now. Thanks for your help with that, @!$0#$b#I've had to do that a few times before, on the beach and in the forest, but it's almost never THAT bad.$2",
"CT.Leah.DylanTown": "Dylan stopped for a chat earlier. I'm glad to see him feeling better.$0#$b#We both had a laugh at the look Eli had on his face when Pam accosted him. Doesn't he deal with monsters for a living?$1",
"CT.Leah.DylanSaloon": "Hi, @! I'm sorry that we got a tad carried away the other night.$0#$b#We must do it again sometime!$1",
"CT.Leah.DylanCCAquarium": "That aquarium in the Community Center is quite something, isn't it? A work of art, even. Maybe I should try designing an aquascape someday...$1",

//ELLIOTT

"CT.Elliott.EliIntro": "Aha! That is the look of somebody who met the positively ebullient Eli recently. What a character that man is.$0#$b#I don't believe I'd ever met anyone with such an infectious energy before he and Dylan moved to the Valley, not long after myself.$1#$b#He's surprisingly well read, too. He often inquires after my literary aspirations... and he tells the most thrilling horror stories.$0",

"CT.Elliott.DylanIntro": "Dylan's work often takes him near my shack. He may not be much in the way of socialising, but he never says no to the offer of a hot beverage.$0#$b#Sometimes he talks about his work whilst I listen. I get the impression that he does appreciate my occasional companionship.$1",
"CT.Elliott.DylanBeach": "Hello, @. As much as I appreciated your efforts, I'd like to profusely apologise for being unable to assist you and Dylan earlier.$2#$b#I was held captive at my writing desk by a brilliant spark of inspiration that I had to commit to paper before I forgot.$0#$b#Such is the peril of being an aspiring writer.$1",
"CT.Elliott.DylanTown": "Do you think that Leah and I came on a bit too strongly when we extended our offer to Dylan? I'd hate to think that we scared him off.$2#$b#Still, he did say that he would consider joining us. It is more than we'd hoped for.$1",
"CT.Elliott.DylanSaloon": "Oh dear... I fear that our revels left poor Gus's establishment in quite a sorry state.$2#$b#Still, it feels good to let my hair down occasionally. I hope that you enjoyed yourself, @.$1",
"CT.Elliott.DylanCCAquarium": "After seeing that aquarium of Dylan's, I can feel a poem taking vivid form. I shall have to retire to my shack soon and commit it to paper.$1",

//HARVEY

"CT.Harvey.EliMushroomCave": "Eli stopped by earlier, covered in cuts and scrapes. And not for the first time, either. It was all Maru and I could do to get him to stay still long enough to treat him!$2#$b#I'm glad that you were with him when he fell, @. It could've been a lot more serious if he'd landed differently.$0#$b#I worry about these adventurer types, going into dangerous places all the time.$2",

"CT.Harvey.DylanSaloon": "I bumped into Eli on my way out of the Saloon and tried to check him over. Apparently the skirmish over at the mines was a big one.$0#$b#He refused and ran past me. I think Dylan had too much to drink as well... what'll I do with those two?$2",

"CT.Harvey.EnDClinicAppointment": "Eli visited the clinic earlier and brought Maru and I a coffee each. That was very kind of him!$1#$b#I hope he didn't feel obligated to apologise for being anxious there. He's far from the most difficult patient I've had.$2",

//ABIGAIL

"CT.Abigail.EliIntro": "I've seen Eli going into the mines before. I think he does part time work for the Adventurer's Guild? I kind of envy him.$0#$b#Do you think he'd let me try out his sword if I bug him enough?$1",
"CT.Abigail.EliWoods": "I looked out of the window at the town square last night and saw Eli... flickering into the shadows and reappearing on top of a roof. He didn't see me.$3#$b#I always figured there was something strange about him. I know it sounds crazy, but I know what I saw.$2#$b#I wish I could do that...$1",
"CT.Abigail.EliGuild": "I totally defeated Eli in a sword fight! You should've seen me, @ - I knocked him on his ass!$1#$b#Sure, he got some good hits in - but if I can beat someone who works for the Guild, then how tough can the mines be?$0",

//PIERRE

"CT.Pierre.EliGuild": "I think Abigail's been fighting again. She came home covered in dirt and bruises.$2#$b#It had better not be Sam or Sebastian again! I really don't need to have another word with their mothers.$3",
"CT.Pierre.EnDJojaBreak": "I heard that Morris tried to give Eli a hard time earlier. That incident was a long time ago and from what I heard, it didn't even affect JojaMart's sales!$3#$b#Eli's overenthusiasm has caused accidents in my shop as well, but he always apologised and tried to clear it up. I wouldn't BAN him for it.$2",

//SEBASTIAN

"CT.Sebastian.EliJunimo1": "I never really know what to make of Eli. He's nice and all, but the way he talks and acts sometimes... I'm not sure if he's all there.$2#$b#The crafty way he grins at you, like he knows something you don't. And he KNOWS that you know he knows you don't know.$0#$b#I'm not judging him, though. I'm a bit weird myself. So's Abby.$1",

//SAM

"CT.Sam.EnDJojaBreak": "That was the first time I'd seen the Morays lose their cool. Dylan's pretty no-nonsense, but Eli? I didn't think he could glare at someone like that!$8#$b#Morris kept to himself for the rest of our shift. It was like he'd deflated or something.$1",

//WILLY

"CT.Willy.DylanIntro": "I like that Dylan. Sometimes he asks to see my catch for his research. He knows better than many that the ocean deserves respect.$0#$b#He and Eli are from Point Drake along the coast - I've been there before. They're both good lads, even if one's rowdier than the other.$1",
"CT.Willy.DylanBeach": "The sea's been a cruel mistress to me as of late. I've been catching more junk than fish!$2",
"CT.Willy.DylanSaloon": "Heh heh, I wasn't expecting to see Dylan get so comfortable so soon in the Saloon.$1#$b#I'm glad the lad's starting to come out of his shell at last.$0",
"CT.Willy.DylanExpedition": "Heh, that's quite a contraption that Maru built. I wonder if they can be fitted with nets... not that I'm worried! No machine can replace my job.$0#$b#Dylan showed me the footage you lot took. What a treat! I hope we can do that again sometime.$1",

//PENNY

"CT.Penny.DylanLibrary": "Hello, @. I honestly didn't expect Dylan to agree to help me in a million years!$1#$b#I'm looking forward to seeing him teach. Although naturally, I'll be on hand as well.$0",
"CT.Penny.DylanLesson": "Wasn't Dylan amazing, @? The children had such a good time! Maybe I should convince him to give lessons more often.$1#$b#I hope the experience gave him a boost in confidence. I honestly think he surprised himself.$0",

//VINCENT

"CT.Vincent.DylanLibrary": "Miss Penny says that we're going on a field trip to the beach!$0#$b#I'm gonna put a crab in Jas' hair when no one's looking.$1",
"CT.Vincent.DylanLesson": "Mister Moray's lesson was so cool! I hope he teaches us about sharks next time.$1",

//JAS

"CT.Jas.DylanLibrary": "I'm super excited for that field trip! Mister Moray's going to teach us. Miss Penny said he's very smart.$1",
"CT.Jas.DylanLesson": "That field trip was really fun! Wasn't that octopus cute?$1",

//KROBUS

"CT.Krobus.EliWoods": "I enjoyed our evening out, @. We must do it again someday.$1",

//MARLON

"CT.Marlon.EliIntro": "Eli? He's a cryptozoologist, which is a fancy way of saying he spends his time searching for creatures that don't exist.$0#$b#He knows his stuff when it comes to real monsters, though. And he's a decent fighter - he does jobs for us sometimes.$0",

"CT.Marlon.DylanSaloon": "The other night was a hectic one. Occasionally the monsters in the mine form hordes and try to reach town.$0#$b#We're unsure what causes them to coordinate like that. But we kept them at bay - Eli was a good help.$0",

//MARLON (SVE)

"CT.MarlonSVE.EliIntro": "Eli? He's a cryptozoologist, which is a fancy way of saying he spends his time searching for creatures that don't exist.$0#$b#He knows his stuff when it comes to real monsters, though. And he's a decent fighter - he does jobs for us sometimes.$1",

"CT.MarlonSVE.DylanSaloon": "The other night was a hectic one. Occasionally the monsters in the mine form hordes and try to reach town.$2#$b#We're unsure what causes them to coordinate like that. But we successfully kept them at bay - Eli was a good help.$1",

//QUESTS

"SpecialOrders.FairyRingOffering.Name": "Offering to the Woods",
"SpecialOrders.FairyRingOffering.Text": "Eli is convinced that the faerie ring you discovered deep in the woods is important, and that something may happen if you leave an offering. It could just be another far fetched theory of his... but nothing ventured, nothing gained?",
"SpecialOrders.FairyRingOffering.ObjectiveText.1": "Leave 25 crops, flowers, animal products or forage in the box at Eli and Dylan's house.",

"SpecialOrders.DroneComponents.Name": "Into the Abyss",

"Events.EliIntro.Question.1.Response.1": "I'm glad to hear it! I'm pretty new myself. Me and my brother are a pair of harbour rats from Point Drake. We got here about a year ago.$1#$b#It's a small and quiet town, but that was a big part of the appeal for us. I get the feeling you came here for similar reasons.$0",
"Events.EliIntro.Question.1.Response.2": "I get that. My brother and I come from Point Drake, it's a small port city. When we came here a year ago it was hard to adapt to the sudden quiet.$0#$b#I was so used to hearing traffic and sirens through the night that it felt almost deafening.$11#$b#But there's a sense of community spirit here you just won't find in the cities. Give it time and I'm sure you'll love it too!$1",
"Events.EliIntro.Question.1.Response.3": "...Not much, actually. Mainly just admiring the view from here. The Mayor recently left this building unlocked so I thought I'd poke around inside.$0#$b#It was totally worth the visit.

//RELUCTANT MONSTER SLAYER

"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.1": "Greetings, Clint!",
"Events.EliGuild.Clint.1": "Um... hi, Marlon. I was wondering if there was any word on those tools I lost in the mines?$0#$b#Orders are piling up and I can't get anything done without them. I shouldn't have pushed my luck while looking for ore the other day. Stupid monsters...$2",
"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.2": "I gave Eli that job earlier. He's in the mines now, but it shouldn't take him long to return with your belongings.$0",
"Events.EliGuild.Clint.2": "Oh, that's good to hear!$1#$b#I didn't know that Eli is part of the Guild. Doesn't he look for... you know, crop circles and mythical creatures?$0",
"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.3": "He's not an official member, but he does jobs for us. Unfortunately, cryptozoology doesn't pay his bills.$0#$b#Still, he's reliable and knows how to handle himself. And his background in studying GENUINE monsters has been useful.$0",
"Events.EliGuild.NovaEli.1": "Hello!",
"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.4": "Speak of the devil...",
"Events.EliGuild.NovaEli.2": "Sorry I'm late! I had a bit of aggro with a bunch of squid kids on my way out. And then the dumb elevator wouldn't start!$12#$b#So I kicked the mechanism a few times and gave the panel a good whack. That got it moving just before the monsters caught up.$1",
"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.5": "You're literally the only one I know who's managed to jam that elevator.",

"Events.EliGuild.NovaEli.4": "More importantly, I managed to recover your gear. Is this all of it, Clint?$1",

"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.6": "You would have an easier time of it if you actually killed the monsters, Eli.$0",
"Events.EliGuild.NovaEli.5": "I know that, but I'm not comfortable with it. My life wasn't in immediate danger and neither was anyone else's.$2#$b#Yeah, I just dodged past them all. But I got the job done, didn't I?$10",
"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.7": "*Sigh*",
"Events.EliGuild.Marlon.8": "That you did, lad. Those monsters will undoubtedly have to be eradicated when they find their way to the surface, but the job was done.$0#$b#I'm just going to go over this itemized list of Clint's belongings so I can bill him.

"Events.EliGuild.Abigail.1": "Hey, Eli!",
"Events.EliGuild.Abigail.2": "What was it like down there? Were there a lot of monsters this time?$1",
"Events.EliGuild.NovaEli.6": "No more than usual! It was pretty routine. Clint got chased out by monsters yesterday so I had to get his stuff back.$11#$b#What're you doing here, anyway? Trying to wake Gil? You'd have an easier time trying to wake the dead.$1#$b#Or... you're not thinking about sneaking down into the mines, are you?$9",
"Events.EliGuild.Abigail.3": "What's that meant to mean? Do you think I can't handle myself? You're the one who's been giving me sword practice!$5",
"Events.EliGuild.NovaEli.7": "Hey, it's not like that - I'm not gonna gatekeep you! You're an adult and you know the risks.$7#$b#But I am NOT getting the blame pinned on me by your dad. I'd get banned from the only other store in town and then Dylan will probably murder me.$9",
"Events.EliGuild.Abigail.4": "No, you're right. Sorry for getting defensive... you're already taking a risk by helping me as much as you have.$2#$b#I just wish my dad would come around to the idea, you know? I swear he still thinks I'm a literal child.$0",
"Events.EliGuild.NovaEli.8": "I hope he starts believing in you, too. Tell you what, we can have another duel later if you want.$1#$b#But I won't go easy on you.$6",
"Events.EliGuild.Abigail.5": "Oh, you're asking for it with that cocky attitude! I'll defeat you this time, you just wait and see!$1",

"Events.EliGuestRoom.Question.1.Answer.2": "What were you expecting to find?",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.Question.1.Response.1": "That hasn't happened before. Rasmodius put a bunch of wards on that door, nobody should be able to get in here.$11",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.Question.1.Response.2": "This room isn't always empty when it manifests. Sometimes... things from the other side hitch a ride in it. And I have to deal with them.$11",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.NovaEli.3": "This is our guest room... or at least, it was before I displaced it. If you want to be technical, it doesn't even exist anymore.$0#$b#I used it to try and open a small doorway to the Void, using an old ritual I found in a book at the library. But I monumentally screwed it up.$10",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.Question.2.Answer.1": "Why would you even want to DO that?!",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.Question.2.Answer.2": "Can it be fixed?",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.Question.2.Response.1": "I had this theory that the Shadow People might originate there. We still know so little about them! Not to mention the cryptids said to live there.$1#$b#I did get a look before everything went wrong. No Shadow People, but what I saw was... I can't describe it. Amazing. Terrifying. But mostly amazing!$3",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.Question.2.Response.2": "Rasmodius reckons that what happened here can't be reversed. He said the room's in a state of 'permanent dimensional flux', that it's become attuned to the Void.$11#$b#It's pretty inconvenient, I won't lie to you. Our guests have to settle for the couch these days.$2",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.NovaEli.4": "Rasmodius knew what I was doing, no idea how. And he put a stop to it before it got too out of hand.$2#$b#If he hadn't, the Void might've leaked out past this house. But the anomalies are mostly confined to this room. It won't get any worse.$9",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.NovaEli.5": "And that's our cue to leave! It's about to shift again and we don't wanna be here when it does, HURRY!$7",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.NovaEli.6": "Close one! It'll be gone now until whenever the next storm hits. I wonder if the denizens of the Void find it as weird as we do? Having a random room just show up there.$11",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.NovaEli.7": "Oh FUCK!",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.NovaEli.8": "*Huff*...",
"Events.EliGuestRoom.NovaEli.9": "I... *huff* I hope I've made my point, @. Please stay out of there, yeah?$10#$b#So... with that said... do you want to stay round for a mug of coffee? I can put the kettle on for you!$12",

"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.1.Answer.2": "You're going to catch your death.",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.1.Response.1.1": "Because insomnia's a pain, that's why. I've been amped up all day and I know that if I go to bed now, I'll still be up for the rest of the night.$10#$b#I can normally tell when it'll just be a waste of time. So I spend the night reading, or stay out to clear my head.$0",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.1.Response.1.2": "Maybe tomorrow I'll be able to get some shut-eye. It's just the hand I've been dealt, @ - all I can do is try to make the best of it.$9",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.1.Response.2.1": "Nah, I like the rain. I find it sort of comforting, you know? Not to mention refreshing. Plus I love that fresh earthy smell!$0#$b#On nights like this, the sound of rain sometimes helps me get to sleep. But I'm still way too amped up, so I'm not gonna bother trying.$2",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.1.Response.2.2": "I've lived with insomnia for most of my life... 0/10, do not recommend. It's just the way it goes, @.$9",

"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.2.Response.2": "Oh, I don't know how you've got the patience for that fishing lark! I hate sitting still for too long. Maybe if I had a big net and a jetski...$11#$b#But Willy and Elliott would probably accuse me of cheating, wouldn't they?$10",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.2.Response.3": "That's fair! I don't mind just listening to the sounds of the woods, but it was nice of you to stop by and keep me company for a bit.$1#$b#Seriously, though - if you need to head back now, that's absolutely fine. You farmers get up at, what... 5am? 6am?$0",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.2.Response.4.1": "PFFFFFT!",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Question.2.Response.4.2": "Wait, seriously? That was one of the LAST things I expected you to say, ahahahahahaha!$3#$b#Hey, I don't judge! Maybe you found cookies in Evelyn's trash or a diamond in the mayor's. One person's junk is someone else's treasure, right?$1",
"Events.EliNightOwl.NovaEli.3": "So anyway -",

"Events.EliNightOwl.NovaEli.5": "Yeah, @ fell asleep when I was about to tell them a funny story. I'd better carry our farmer friend back home.$10",
"Events.EliNightOwl.Shane.2": "Here, I'll give you a hand.$0",

"Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.5": "Here, take a closer look.$0",
"Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.6": "It's really cool, isn't it? Tide pools like this one are everywhere, but not many people stop to appreciate them.$3#$b#They're little oases that offer us a small glimpse of life under the sea.$1#$b#And the best part is that they transform every day as new creatures move in or out. It's always a bit different.$3",
"Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.7": "There's all sorts of theories on where life originated. It could've been by hydrothermal vents down in the abyss... or maybe even terrestrial pools like this one.$0#$b#But yeah, this is what I do.

I know there's only so much he can do, but surely he doesn't want his town to be a pit of squalor?$1#$b#Back in Point Drake, the problem was worse because of higher population density and apathy in the city council.

I think they could learn a lot from you!$1#$b#I've seen you crouched over tide pools plenty of times. A lesson about those habitats and their inhabitants would be both fun and educational.$0",

"Events.DylanLibrary.Penny.7": "I think they might surprise you, Dylan. And perhaps more importantly, you might surprise yourself.$0#$b#You don't have to give me a definite answer now. Take some time to think it over, alright? And if it's too uncomfortable for you, I'll understand.$0",

"Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.8": "Well, that thing certainly had eyes! It must've seen us, right??$9",
"Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.10": "Oh, it definitely saw us. But maybe we're too small to be worth capturing? Or perhaps the lights scared it off.$1#$b#That was too big to be a giant squid or even a colossal squid. I've got so many questions right now! I sure hope we see another one.$3",

"Events.DylanExpedition.Demetrius.5": "It's so... primordial. That's the only word I can think of for it right now. We're looking at something that few humans have ever laid eyes on.$1",
"Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.12": "Just look at it all!",
"Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.13": "Giant tube worms! It's not surprising to see them here. There's a lot of hydrothermal vents for them to live near.$1#$b#Let's nab a few samples while we're passing through.$0",

"Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.11": "Unfortunately, the ROV isn't capable of diving under the brine. It's too dense, we'd just end up floating on top.$0#$b#And we'd better start heading back now if we're to have enough power to reach the surface.$3",
"Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.16": "No matter. We can always come back another time. For now, we have what we came for.$1",
