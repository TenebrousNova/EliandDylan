"Core.NovaEli.Introduction": "%Eli notices you with a curious glance before breaking into an easy grin and enthusiastically shaking your hand.#$b#A stranger? You can only be the new farmer that everyone's been talking about. Name's Eli, I'm fairly new to the Valley myself. It's nice to finally meet you!$1#$b# If you haven't met my brother Dylan yet, he's usually hanging around one of the beaches. He's a bit standoffish but he'll soon warm up to you.$0#$e#Perhaps I'll be seeing you around.$1",

//DYNAMIC DIALOGUE

"Core.NovaEli.MateoEmeritus.Unhatched": "I'm really envious at Mateo for getting hold of that pepper rex egg. I've seen plenty of wild juveniles and adults before, but the nests are always hard to get to.$1#$b#Pepper rex husbandry isn't well documented because most people wouldn't dare try it. This is a great research opportunity for me!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.MateoEmeritus.Hatched": "Watching Emeritus thrive under Mateo's care has been incredible! I've learned a lot about how pepper rexes develop throughout their lives because of it.$3#$b#I'm still super jealous of Mateo, but after seeing them literally knee deep in dino crap... I'm relieved to just be 'Uncle Eli' instead.$10",

//IMPORTANT DATES

"Core.NovaEli.Spring.2.2": "Hello there, farmer! Must be a relief for you to start planting stuff again.$1#$b#I like Winter myself, but most of my income comes from dungeon delving anyway.$0#$b#Not that I make much.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.3.1": "Joja made a right cock-up of their 'drilling operation' in the mountains. Thanks to them the pass leading to the railroad is totally blocked off by rubble.$9#$b#The mines, too! I get that they're a necessary evil because the local economy is strapped, but I wish Lewis would tell Morris where he can stick his jackhammer.$8",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.12": "Looking forward to tomorrow's bash at the town square? I kind of envy you for being allowed to take part in the egg hunt.$0#$b#Mayor Lewis takes issue with my age and Dylan seems to think I'd cheat. And Rasmodius. And half my neighbours. As if I would!$11#$e#Still, I'm not yet barred from the food. You better get there before I do, farmer.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.23": "I'll be honest, I'm not looking forward to the Flower Dance. We had to rent these ugly suits from a place in Grampleton.$2#$b#Also, there's no way anyone would want to dance with me after the first time.$9#$b#What happened? ...Another time. I wouldn't want you to feel second hand shame.$12#$e#I don't care what people think, I refuse to shave for the festival.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.Spring.27": "I can't believe we're almost into Summer already. Imagine it, @.$0#$b#Swimming in the sparkling ocean by day, watching the fireflies dance at night... and those strange ritualistic sacrifices the townsfolk make to the Junimos under a blood moon.$1#$e#Haha, relax! I'm just yanking your chain. You don't HAVE to go swimming if you don't want to.$6",


"Core.NovaEli.Summer.10": "Tomorrow's gonna be fantastic, farmer. The Luau is one of those occasions that really make you feel like part of the community.$1#$b#Sure, Point Drake has its festivals and they're not bad at all. But they just don't have that wholesome energy you get at small town events, you know?$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Summer.27": "I'm going to need to have a little word with Dylan before we go out to the beach tomorrow evening...$9#$b#He has to be reminded sometimes that he's meant to relax and enjoy the Lunaloos, instead of scribbling notes on their behaviour and recording their numbers the whole night.$10#$e#I love my work too, but it's important to separate it from your life sometimes, you know?$0",

"Core.NovaEli.Fall.15": "Hey farmer, are you nervous about tomorrow's fair? You shouldn't be! You'll knock the rest of them out of the park, I know it.$1#$b#Me? I'll definitely be there. Although I might also take the trip to Grampleton to see what theirs is like.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Fall.17": "@! Dylan probably didn't tell you, but it's his birthday tomorrow. He never expects people to make a big fuss over it.$1#$b#He always gets totally flustered when people get him a present, though.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.Fall.26": "I hope you're ready for the one day of the year that it's 'socially acceptable' for people to get done up in spooky costumes, @!$1#$b#I told Dylan I want to get some real work done since supernatural forces will be at their peak, but he went and called me out for hypocrisy.$8#$e#I'm still going to do it anyway once the festivities die down. It's an opportunity I can't afford to waste.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.Fall.28": "Ready for Winter, farmer? I bet it's going to be nice having a whole season where you won't be working the fields.$0#$b#What will you do in the meantime? Go cave diving? Reorganise everything?$1",

"Core.NovaEli.Winter.5": "Man, I can't believe I've got another impending birthday. It's something I never really think about until it's right round the corner.$1#$b#I'll probably just have a nice and quiet day, maybe watch a movie or two. I don't need a big celebration to have a good time.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.7": "Are you going to the Ice Festival tomorrow, @? It's bloody freezing, but worth it just to see the awesome ice sculptures people make.$1#$b#I can't join in, though. The festival takes place in the forest, so I volunteered to keep an eye out for monsters that might get drawn to all the noise.$0#$e#Worry not, farmer. You and everyone else will be quite safe in my capable hands.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.15": "If you're going to the submarine, do me a solid and remind Dylan to at LEAST eat and drink occasionally while he's staring at the deep sea life.$9#$b#I'm one to talk, but he is obsessive. First year, he was literally camped out in that tub. The captain had to ask me to help drag him back out when the Night Market ended.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.16": "In case you're wondering, that Mermaid at the Night Market is the real deal. Patient, too. I've been bombarding her with questions non-stop!$1#$b#What do you mean I have 'confirmation bias'? I'm telling you that she's real! It's literally my JOB to know this stuff!$8",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.17": "The Night Market definitely doesn't help my caffeine addiction, but I'm not gonna complain!$3#$b#That merchant's coffee is something else. I'll be sorry to see her go.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.18": "I got a letter today telling me who my 'secret friend' will be for Winter Star. Got yours as well? Great!$1#$b#Not to worry, I won't ask who it is. I don't need the mayor ranting at me again.$12",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.24": "Dylan and me never really celebrated Winter Star before we moved to the Valley. We didn't have any reason to.$2#$b#Our first time experiencing it here was very different! We were strangers, misfits, but the folk here went out of their way to welcome us with open arms.$0#$b#And we can't even begin to thank them enough for that. I hope we'll see you celebrating with us tomorrow, @.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Winter.28": "Another year come and gone, farmer. Excited for the next one? I'll bet Pierre has missed you and especially your wallet.$6#$b#As for me, I'll be up to my usual shenanigans. I've a good feeling about next year.$1",

//Festival Lines

"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judging": "Oh, Lewis is starting the judging? Sweet! Best of luck to you. Let me know how it goes, yeah?$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerLost_PurpleShorts": "AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH I can't believe you did that, holy shit! The LOOK on the old codger's face!$3#$b#Wait, he BRIBED you as well? I just - I can't -! I need a minute...$7#$b#%Eli is crying from laughing so hard.",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerLost_Skipped": "Oh, you didn't feel up to participating this time? That's too bad. But hey, there's always next year.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerLost": "You lost? Aww, I'm sorry to hear that @. I'm sure you tried your best. And there's always next year, right?$2",
"Core.NovaEli.Fair_Judged_PlayerWon": "You WON?! That's fantastic news @, I knew you had it in you!$3#$b#Pierre's gonna be sulking about this one for a while.$6",

"Core.NovaEli.FlowerDanceAccept": "Dance? With me? Ah, what the hell. I'll try not to screw it up. Alright, let's get this trainwreck started!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.DanceRejection": "Oh! That's sweet of you, @. And on any other day I'd probably say yes. But I don't want a repeat of what happened the last time someone asked me to dance.$2#$b#I'll give you a hint: we both ended up in the clinic shortly after. With multiple fractured bones. You'll find a more competent dance partner, I'm sure.$10",

"Core.NovaEli.WinterStar_GiveGift_Before": "Hey @, it's your lucky day! You're my secret friend this year.$1#$b#I had a hard time deciding what to get you, but I hope you like it. Anyway, get unwrapping!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.WinterStar_GiveGift_After": "Ta-da! That moment never gets old, does it? Take it easy, @ - have a cracking Winter Star.$1",

//0-4 HEARTS

//About Eli

"Core.NovaEli.0-4.1": "My job? I'm a cryptozoologist. I study monsters and try to discover new ones. I've also been doing a lot of research into the supernatural and occult.$1#$b#Yeah, I recognise that expression. Not to worry, I'm used to people thinking I'm a little... eccentric.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.2": "*Yaaaaaaaaawn* Hey @. Didn't get any sleep at all last night...$9#$b#%Eli seems to become completely unresponsive before abruptly jerking awake seconds later.#$b#Where...? Sorry mate... I wouldn't make good company right now.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.3": "I should try to get to the Saloon more often. Not for the drink, I swore off that years ago.$0#$b#But sometimes I just need the company. They think I'm a nutjob, but they seem to tolerate me? Or at least pretend to.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.4": "%Eli seems lost in thought as he idly fidgets with his pendant. You glimpse a gleaming ivory fang, covered in tiny etched runes. Something about it unsettles you.",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.5": "%Eli doesn't notice you as he walks along. He's murmuring strange words to himself. You don't understand them, but hearing them makes your teeth and bones ache.",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.6": "I reckon I'll put on a horror movie tonight. I've seen practically all of them and they're filled with clichés, but they never get old.$1#$b#It's funnier watching them as someone who's regularly at the sharp end. Those clueless movie heroes wouldn't last five seconds against a real monster!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.7": "I wonder what's going on back at Point Drake? It's been a long time since we left the port.$0#$b#Not that I ever plan to leave the Valley! It'll be my home until Lewis finally gets fed up and kicks me out.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.8": "I managed to beat Journey of the Prairie King! I'm dead chuffed, it took me long enough.$3#$b#Dylan was there - he can back me up! He was very impressed. And then he challenged me to beat it without losing any lives.$1#$b#Yeah, no. Not happening. I'm not a masochist.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.9": "One of my favourite things to do at night is go down to the beach and watch the fog come rolling in.$1#$b#It's an otherworldly sight. Sometimes I catch fleeting glimpses of silhouettes in the fog. They're like strange, lost spirits.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.10": "%Eli seems to be in a particularly exuberant mood today, even for him. You struggle to keep up with his excitable babbling before he dashes away.",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.11": "%Eli is vigorously rubbing his eyes. He looks exhausted.#$b#Hi @. Another shitty night... I swear that the sleeping pills Dr. Harvey prescribed me don't work half the time.$9#$b#If you happen to have a tranquilizer gun in that backpack somewhere, preferably one capable of knocking out a Pepper Rex, feel free to use it on me. Please.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.12": "Have you seen much of Ferngill, @? Me, I've spent most of my life in Point Drake. It's a lovely place perched on a peninsula by the Gem Sea.$1#$b#But things didn't work out for us there, so we struck out for Stardew Valley to make a new life.$0#$e#From what I heard, you left the City for similar reasons. I've never been there, but I'd like to visit one day.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.13": "I've actually got a blog on cryptozoology. Something that'll shake the stones of my profession to its very foundations.$0#$b#Well, alright. Barely anyone reads it. But I can't do worse than the amateurs that write sensationalist tabloid garbage like Crypto Today.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.14": "I suppose that if I'm ever hard pressed for cash, I could always have a side gig as a magician for kid's parties or something.$2#$b#I can do one hell of a disappearing act.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.15": "%As Eli greets you, you notice there's this strange reverb to his voice.#$b#MORTAL! What do you think of this effect I'm working on for Spirit's Eve? Answer truly, before I claim your soul as my plaything. For ETERNITY!$19#$b#Haha, fine! I'll stop. I'm really happy with how that turned out though. I should do it in front of those Yoba worshippers on Sunday.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.16": "I tried to give myself a lucid dream last night. You know, when you're fully aware that you're in the dream and can control it?$0#$b#After a while it actually worked! I was there, but was still sort of aware of being in bed. And yeah, I could fly!$1#$b# But then I got so excited that I immediately woke up. Isn't that just bleeding typical.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.17": "How did I get banned from JojaMart? Oh boy, @... fine, I'll give you the short version.$9#$b#The truth is that I tripped over, completely by accident. Which caused a chain reaction that ended in Morris getting publically humiliated.$10#$b#On the plus side, Shane was laughing his head off. He and Sam got me a pizza that night. Said they'll always treasure the memory of Morris crushed beneath those shelves.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.18": "Growing up, I learned fast that I shouldn't care about being different from others. That I should embrace my quirks.$1#$b#Who wants to be 'normal', anyway? If everyone was normal, the world would be a very boring place.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.19": "%Eli is fidgeting with his pendant and notices you looking at it.#$b#Oh, this? It's a talisman I carved myself. Has some strong magic. It's a fang from a Sea Drake!$1#$b#Point Drake was named after them - it was once their nesting ground. A lot of people think they're long extinct or never even existed, but I know they're out there. This is proof.$3#$b#It's a big reason that I went into cryptozoology in the first place. Neat, huh?$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.20": "What's up, @. It's a good day isn't it? Uh... how come you're staring at me like that?$17#$b#Well, I guess you're only human.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.21": "I was on the Community Center roof earlier- while Lewis wasn't looking of course. I spend quite a lot of time on rooftops.$0#$b#You should join me one evening! Watching people go about their business below, enjoying town from a new perspective. It makes you feel wild and free.$1#$e#Don't fret, farmer! I'd always be there to catch you.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.22": "Do you ever get the feeling that people act friendly to your face, but they're just too polite to say what they really think?$9#$b#That's how I feel with most people who talk to me. I know what I'm like, @. Sorry if I've ever been obnoxious around you.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.23": "I had an unsettling dream last night. I was back at Point Drake, walking down the dimly lit street to our old apartment block. The door was unlocked, so I went in.$0#$b#The furniture was how I remembered, but every surface was covered in thick dust. There was no one around. Then the door bell rang behind me.$9#$b#I opened the door and whatever it was, it was terrifying enough that I woke up at 3am. I think it had my face.$2#$e#I immediately brewed myself a coffee. And Dr. Harvey wonders why I have trouble sleeping...$9",

//About Family

"Core.NovaEli.0-4.24": "Don't worry if Dylan seems short with you. He's a bit slow to trust and doesn't spend much time around people.$0#$b#He's a marine biologist. Get him on the subject of sea life and he won't shut up.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.25": "I caught Soot trying to get into the cupboards this morning, bless him. Luckily Dylan wasn't there.$3#$b#I get that a Dust Sprite is a really unusual pet, but how could I not? Yeah, he's a rascal and he's still a bit feral. But he's way too adorable to get mad at.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.26": "I took Soot to the vet the other day for a checkup. You should've seen the look on Jacob's face!$0#$b#'But Eli, I wasn't taught how to treat monsters at veterinary school!'$11#$b#Maybe he should branch out! Become a monster vet as well, then I can get Soot microchipped.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.27": "Dylan's fancy aquarium hypnotises me sometimes - there's an entire ecosystem in there that I could honestly stare at for hours on end.$1#$b#I don't trust that octopus of his, though. She's always watching. Always plotting.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.28": "Having a Dust Sprite for a pet has surprising benefits. Did you know that they actually feed on dust and detritus of all kinds? They sort of absorb it.$1#$b#Just don't upset him or he'll expel that dust everywhere. We've learned that the hard way.$10",

//About Friends & Neighbours

"Core.NovaEli.0-4.29": "Aideen chewed me out earlier because I tripped and almost faceplanted in the flowers outside her garden fence.$10#$b#Don't let that woman fool you, @. She might seem kindly, but she could flay you alive with that viciously barbed tongue of hers.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.30": "Have you checked out the East Scarp Inn? It's not quite as lively as Gus's place but it's still a fun place to hang out.$0#$b#Rosa's a kind soul! She listens to me nattering on about my work with great patience.$1#$b#She even asks questions. I'm grateful for that.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.31": "I've never actually met a Vampire before, but I know they're out there. Most people would never know their friend or neighbour's a bloodsucker until it's too late.$9#$b#Hmm... what about that Sebastian kid? Alabaster complexion, edgy fashion, secretive nature...$11#$e#What if Abigail's one of them too? Sweet Yoba's backside, what sinister conspiracy have I stumbled upon?! What if they're ALL in on it?$7#$b#This stays between us, @. Nobody can ever know that we know.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.32": "I rather like that Emily. She's non-judgemental and doesn't look at me like I've grown an extra head whenever I open my gob.$0#$b#Pretty sure she's a devout worshipper of Yoba, though. She might not be so open minded if she knew about the kind of things I dabble in.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.33": "That Abigail seems really interested in my work! She's always pelting me with questions when I stop by Pierre's for groceries.$1#$b#She's got a lot of potential. All she's lacking is the confidence to really go for it. Also I heard rumours that-$0#$b#...Nevermind, @. It's just gossip. I shouldn't listen to Dylan so much.$12",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.34": "I bumped into Elliott the other day and he offered me coffee over his campfire. He's a decent bloke, good at reading people and always has good advice.$1#$b#I asked if he'd ever consider writing horror and he said he'd give it some thought. I think he prefers to write sappy romance, though.$3#$e#I mean, look at him. The man looks and dresses like he walked straight off the front cover of a romance novel.$0#$b#I should ask him if he'd let me have an early sneak peek at his work. I like romance! It's not a guilty pleasure if I don't feel guilt.$12",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.35": "Space seems to be strangely distorted in the mines. Ever noticed that most floors you've visited usually look totally different when you come back?$0#$b#I asked Maru for a rational explanation and she started going on about this theory that each floor could be in a quantum superposition.$1#$e#And that they collapse into one of several possibilities when observed by a human.$11#$b#Whatever that means.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.36": "You know @, I envy you for being able to understand the Junimos. Is there some trick to it?$1#$b#...Rasmodius made you drink WHAT?!$7#$e#Huh... that's interesting, though. Think he'd let me try that 'forest essence' if I bugged him enough? Otherwise, I'll have to stick to playing charades with them.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.37": "Not all of the Shadow People are scared and hostile towards humans. I actually know one who lives close to us.$0#$b#He's a bit shy. But friendly, open minded and positively adorable!$3#$e#I'd love to have him stay at our place, but I misplaced our guest room. Don't ask how.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.38": "Did you know that there's a curious little sea monster that lives nearby? Calls themselves Lexi. I've met them a few times now, but they're very shy.$1#$b#Dylan just scoffed when I told him, but I know I've piqued his professional curiosity. He totally wants to meet my amphibious friend for himself.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.39": "Do you reckon I should challenge Sebastian to a round of pool? I don't think I've ever seen him lose.$0#$b#If I win, I get to see Sam's priceless reaction. If not, there's no shame in losing to a superior player.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.40": "Marlon asked me to spar with him, so I obliged. Then he got miffed at me because I wasn't 'honourable'.$9#$b#Honour is all well and fine when you're practicing, but what good is it in the field?$10#$e#Fighting dirty could make the difference between life and death.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.41": "On days like this I like to pay the East Scarp Inn a visit. Have a fireside chat with Rosa and the others, maybe a round of pool.$0#$b#It's a tight-knit community we've got going on here, unlike anything I'd known before the Valley. I wouldn't give it up for anything.$1",


//Monster/Cryptid Facts

"Core.NovaEli.0-4.42": "If you go into the caves or forest, watch out for Slimes. They look cute and non-threatening, but their touch is highly caustic.$0#$b#They're easy to deal with alone, but don't underestimate them. A large group can easily reduce a grown adult to a half-dissolved skeleton.$9",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.43": "A little ways into the mines you'll find these big aggressive Grubs. Make sure you kill them before they pupate, because they're invincible in that state.$0#$b#They take just seconds to develop into Cave Flies from there. Those things are fast and have a huge mean streak.$9#$e#And if the floor suddenly fills with this green pheromone fog? You'd better run like hell, because a swarm is coming.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.0-4.44": "Careful in the deepest reaches of the mines, @.

"Core.NovaEli.6-10.77": "When the war is over, I want to pay Gotoro a visit one day.

"Core.NovaEli.6-10.84": "Get far enough in the mines and it gets really cold. But that's not the weird part. There seems to be an entire frozen castle buried down there!$1#$b#You can find ancient reanimated Skeletons wandering the ruined halls - hostile, because of course they are.

I think Haley will be around as well but truth be told, I think she pretends I'm not there.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Spring.19": "Have you ever come across those unusual slimes with the star shaped antennae in the mines? I think they're some sort of alpha variant.$1#$b#They're always males as well - female slimes don't have the antenna. I'd love to observe them in more detail, but they're rare and surprisingly vicious for their size.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Spring.20": "What do you reckon Aideen feeds Munchington? The last cat I saw that was anywhere near as massive was chasing down a gazelle on a documentary.$1#$b#He's awfully friendly, but you'll be covered in white fur for the rest of the day if you let him sit on you.$3",

"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.2": "I always have extra trouble getting any sleep on Summer nights. Too hot and humid.$9#$b#Luckily the beach is almost literally on our doorstep. Nothing like a midnight dip in the ocean to cool you down.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.3": "Dunno about you, but I could murder another ice cream right now. I'm becoming one of Alex's best customers.$3#$b#Here, farmer! This one's on me.$1[233]",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.4": "It's a great day for the beach! I'm really lucky to live right next to it.$1#$b#I've got my brother to thank for that. He insisted that we move close to the sea for his work.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.5": "Soot doesn't come out much in the Summer. Too hot for him.$0#$b#His species come from cold environments, so they don't actually molt to adapt to warmer temperatures.$2#$e#I would take him to Jacob to have him trimmed a little, but I'm not sure if you should even do that with Dust Sprites.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.6": "It's hot weather like this that makes me glad I'm not a Metal Head. And no, I'm not talking about THAT sort of metal head.$10#$b#Although I don't mind metal! But before I go off on a musical tangent, where was I?$11#$b#Right! They're heavily armoured monsters found in the deepest levels of the mines. They pack a punch, but they're dead slow. You can run circles round them.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.7": "I swear I go through deodorant so fast this time of year. If Pierre doesn't pull his finger out and order more soon, I'll have to take drastic measures.$11#$b#Like borrow Dylan's. My experience is it's sometimes easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.8": "Do you grow wheat at this time of year, @? I was thinking about the Golden Thresher Worms of Gotoro. They're cryptids I want to track down once there's a ceasefire.$0#So they're these long, spindly looking annelids with quills running down their sides that let them burrow through soil. And when they emerge to bask, they look just like wheat stalks.$1#$b#There's reports of Gotoran farmers going to harvest their wheat, when a threatened worm thrashed around and sliced through the field. And that's how most crop circles are formed!$3#e#You were thinking it was aliens, weren't you? I've gotta run now, but later I'll tell you all about the time I saw a genuine alien.$6",

"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.12": "Back home, there was this old antique shop that sold jewelry which was rumoured to be magical. All way too expensive for me, of course.$0#$b#And sadly the owner doesn't just let you try out the ring of invisibility before you buy it. That would've been SO handy to have!$2",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.13": "Hey, @! A new novel I ordered turned up today, I'm so excited to get stuck into it. The blurb's promised me an emotional rollercoaster of romance, drama and raw angst.$3#$b#And apparently there's an entire SERIES! Dylan reckons I'm pretty sad for enjoying this stuff, but there's nothing wrong with a nice paperback romance.$12",

This hiker saw weird lights in the forest and swears he got chased off by it.$7#$b#It's said to carry a lantern which it uses to lure travellers into hazards so it can eat them. I'm gonna have to organize a trip over there, I've got to see this beast for myself!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.19": "On Saturday nights, I set up a campfire on the Scarp beach with chairs and snacks.

"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Summer.20": "It's been quite a while since I got contracted for any monster research jobs. That was my thing you know, before I seriously took up cryptozoology.$11#$b#The last big job was an on location assignment to study Royal Serpent nesting habits. It was really dangerous, but fun!$1#$b#Paid better than cryptozoology, too. But it is what it is.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.1": "I always thought it was weird how some forms of magic, especially witchcraft and black magic, are vilified no matter what.$11#$b#The way I see it, they're just tools like any other magic. User intent is what matters. If you use witchcraft to help someone and nobody gets hurt, isn't that a good thing?$0",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.2": "On some nights we see strange lights coming from the old orchard just east of our place. Fancy coming on a ghost hunting trip with me one night?$0#$b#There's rumours about the place being haunted. Come on, don't make me beg! It'll be so exciting!$1",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.3": "I hope Linus is going to be alright this Winter. I respect his lifestyle and he's tough as nails, but I still worry sometimes.$2#$b#Do you reckon he'd mind if I got him a new blanket?$11",

"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.5": "Hello, farmer! It's a good idea to sprinkle some salt on your doorstep and windowsills at this time of year.$0#$b#Why? It helps prevent the forces of darkness from entering your home. I'm a bit of an outlier in this regard, but most people don't want anything to do with that.$3#$e#I'd hate for you to get possessed by a Demon or some other malicious entity!$6#$b#Although if that DOES happen... please hit me up! They could tell me so much. And if my incessant questioning scares them out of your body, I guess that's a win-win.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.6": "Carved yourself a Jack-o'-lantern, farmer? Once lit, you mustn't extinguish it. Its purpose is to scare off malevolent spirits that come for you in the night.$0#$b#I'm superstitious? Damn right I am. I meddle with the occult regularly. Do you have any idea what would happen to me if I screwed up?$9#$e#These little protective rituals sound quaint, I know. But trust me, there's a good reason for many of them.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.7": "Fall's my favourite time of the year! I always preferred the cooler seasons, myself.$0#$b#Something about the Fall in particular seems to attract cryptids and other supernatural activity. It's a good time for someone in my profession!$1",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.8": "Alright, @? I bet you've got your hands full right now. Corn, cranberries, eggplants and the like.$0#$b#If you grow some pumpkins, I might pay your farm a visit and pick one out if that's okay!$6#$e#I'm not too shabby at carving them for Spirit's Eve, if I do say so myself.$1",

Last year, I hid myself on Pierre's roof to catch him at it.$0#$b#He showed up in town, then turned around and looked right at me. Next thing I knew, I woke up a few hours before the festival began. The maze was already up.$10#$e#I'll catch him in action next year for certain. Count on it.$8",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.12": "Marlon calls me out more often this time of year. The monsters become more active than usual and try making breaks for the surface.$2#$b#Not to worry, though! They never make it anywhere near town - you're quite safe.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.13": "I'd better stock up on cocoa before the frost sets in. I drink almost as much cocoa during Winter as I do coffee. And that's saying something!$1",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.14": "I'm not entirely sure why the monsters tend to get more agitated during Fall. It can't be a breeding season thing because many species breed year round.$11#$b#There's got to be some kind of supernatural explanation, but what? And I still can't prove it either way.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.15": "The only thing I don't like about this time of year are the perilous dead leaves that cover the roads on rainy days. I'm always slipping on them.$2#$b#Still, it lets people have a good laugh at my expense.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.16": "I'm dead pleased with how my Spirit's Eve costume turned out. And it's no good asking, because I don't do spoilers.$6#$b#I think Dylan actually outdid me though! You just wait 'til you see him, he's got amazing taste.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.17": "Did I ever tell you about the time I saw an alien? It was when me and Dylan went to Minister Valley ages ago. I've seen weird stuff, but not like THAT!$1#$b#I was in the woods one night when I saw bright green lights falling from the sky. I remember all the animals suddenly went quiet. There was this smell of ozone.$1#$b#Then I saw it - a really tall, dark figure in a sort of cloak with long, grasping arms.

Now nobody believes me.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.6-10.Fall.18": "Ugh, a bird managed to crap on me earlier. Emily was all excited and said it's a sign of good luck. For the bird, maybe! I don't feel lucky right now.$10#$b#It better not have been Thistle.$9",

It's always funny to watch her get flustered.$6",

SIGURD/SONDRA*/

"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.1": "Sig reckons he saw crop circles when he was deployed in Gotoro, so I've been pestering him for info. I might have a lead on the Golden Thresher Worms at last!$1#$b#He was showing me some fantastic photos he took. Granted I didn't see any Thresher Worms, but any of those wheat stalks could be one of them. I'm so excited!$1",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.2": "Sondra invited me over to the Lodge the other day for lunch and that place blows me away each time I visit. The Bears are so down to earth, you forget they're minted.$0#$b#I think her coffee machine alone costs more than half our possessions combined. She offered to teach me how to use it, but I'd feel awful if I broke it!$7",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.3": "Sig is fairly gruff and standoffish, but he's a good man. I like him. I think he actually sort of likes me as well, even if the big bastard will never admit it.$3#$b#It's actually kind of scary how observant he is. It feels like he's reading my mind sometimes.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.4": "Man, I wish Sondra was the one who taught me mathematics back in school. She's nothing like the crabby guy who's class I failed back in the day.$1#$b#She loves what she does and tries to make it accessible and fun for everyone. She actually cares, you know?$0",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.5": "%Eli is walking with a limp as he greets you.#$b#Hi, @. Sig and I sometimes have practice duels and he just handed my arse to me.

I can't wait to see his face when that happens.$12",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.6": "Sondra took me aside earlier and started mother henning me. I'm not used to anyone doing that, but she's such a sweetheart that I couldn't say no.$1#$b#It's nice to have such lovely neighbours. I'd like to repay her kindness, but I'm too embarrassed to invite her over for MY cooking.$12",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.7": "Sig's family is from Nors. It's a country I've never been to, but they have some really fascinating mythology and folklore over there for me to get my teeth into.$1#$b#I'll have to ask him for some more book recommendations on the subject. I'd love the chance to find a real Frost Giant!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.8": "Reckon Sondra would give me a hand with our taxes if I asked nicely? I hear that she knows a trick or two that would make life easier on me and Dylan.$11#$b#Just don't tell him yet, because he wouldn't approve of trying to game the system.$6",

I never had the courage to ask what happened to send him home, though.$0#$b#I imagine it has something to do with his scar. I never asked about that either. It seems insensitive, you know?$2",
"Core.NovaEli.SigSondra.10": "I bumped into Sondra and she asked me all about how my research was going. She takes a proper interest, which is a breath of fresh air from the usual skepticism.$1#$b#I think she worries that I'll get hurt on Guild business. Maybe I'll bring her a gemstone next time, if I find any.$11",

//GUNNAR/GUDRUN

"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.1": "Looks like I'm due for more sword practice with Gunnar later. I'm hard on him, but the monsters in the mine aren't going to hold back when they see him.$11#$b#I'll give him credit though - he's never given up. Maybe it's because he gets to watch Sig wipe the floor with me afterwards as a consolation prize.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.2": "I tried telling one of my best jokes to Gudrun earlier, but she wasn't impressed. She must've rolled her eyes hard enough to power Zuzu City.$0#$b#And then she told me that I'm old! I'm not even 30 yet, how's that OLD?!$7",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.3": "I met Gunnar on my last foray into the mine. Something had shredded his t-shirt, and he told me how much it cost - it was more expensive than ANYTHING we own.$2#$b#And he just shrugged and said he'd order another one! Rich people are something else, aren't they? I'll never understand them.$7",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.4": "I see Dylan hanging out a lot with Gudrun these days. I wonder if she's trying to rope him into her ecoterrorism schemes?$2#$b#She certainly seems to respect him more than me. I think it's because I'm a big brother. The dreaded uncool authority figure.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.5": "Emily asked me and Gunnar over to her place later, so we're going to walk there together. It makes a nice change of pace to hang out with friends sometimes.$3#$b#It'd be cool if Sandy showed up as well, since neither of us get to see her very often.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.6": "I saw Sebastian get thoroughly chewed out by Gudrun earlier for throwing his cigarette end into the river. I hadn't laughed that hard in a while.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.7": "Gunnar and I like to tease each other a lot. Sometimes I forget he's Sig's brother until he gets me back - but luckily for me, he's too nice for it to last.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.8": "I saw Gudrun paying at Pierre's with one of those really fancy kind of credit cards. I'VE never owned a credit card. And she's, what? A teenager?$7#$b#Can you imagine the allowance that she and Gunnar probably get? No I'm not envious, not envious in the slightest!$11",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.9": "Gunnar accompanied me on a Guild job and we ended up on one of those infested floors. There were slimes everywhere of all shapes, sizes and colours.$0#$b#He hates the little buggers, you know. If he went against ME with the fight or flight response I saw, I don't know if I could win.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.GunnarGudrun.10": "Gudrun knocked at our door earlier and asked me to sign a petition against overfishing. Her tone was friendly, but her eyes said 'OR ELSE'.$10#$b#I signed it!

//TEREN (PLATONIC)

"Core.NovaEli.TerenPlatonic.1": "Teren's ever so nice, isn't he? I can't remember the last time I managed to befriend anyone as quickly as that. I'm really glad that he moved here.$1#$b#Soot adores him - and he's always been a great judge of character.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.TerenPlatonic.2": "I encountered Teren near the lake the other day. He said he was looking for the Saloon and seemed pretty embarrassed about getting lost. I helped him find his way.$3#$b#Apparently he led his own squad back in Gotoro. I can only assume that Sig was the one actually driving the truck and not him.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.TerenPlatonic.3": "We had Teren over at our place the other evening and played video games. He was pretty good at it until we moved onto a horror game - poor bloke got scared!$3#$b#Everyone had a great time, though. Even Dylan loosens up a little around him.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.TerenPlatonic.4": "It's pretty interesting, listening to Teren's stories about Gotoro. If it weren't for the fact that the war's still raging on, I'd go in a heartbeat.$11#$b#He hasn't told me everything, though... and I don't ask. I'm sure he and Sig have gone through awful shit over there. I'll listen whenever he feels ready.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.TerenPlatonic.5": "Have you tried Teren's baking? He brought some cake over for me and Dylan earlier! I think he said it was a recipe from the ladies in town.$3",

//TEREN (ROMANTIC)

"Core.NovaEli.TerenRomantic.1": "I still can't quite believe my luck that I managed to land a guy like Teren! I have to pinch myself sometimes to make sure I'm not just dreaming it.$3#$b#Huh? You reckon I sound like a big sap, @? Haha, I know! I just can't help it though.$4",
"Core.NovaEli.TerenRomantic.2": "I wasn't really sure about going to the Saloon later with Teren and friends, but then he gave me those puppy eyes and suddenly I had no choice but to agree.$12#$b#There really ought to be a hazard label on him. He's weapons-grade levels of cute and he KNOWS it.$10",

//RODNEY

"Core.NovaEli.Rodney.1": "Rodney pulled me aside at the Inn the other day and told me he's something of a life coach, and that I can stand to benefit from his worldly wisdom.$10#$b#I don't need life coaching! I know exactly what I want. He stormed off when I asked him to point me in the direction of the nearest Chupacabra.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Rodney.2": "I got a tarot card reading from Rodney! He said I'm represented by The Fool. I know The Fool doesn't mean a LITERAL fool, but I still suspected a veiled insult.$10#$b#New beginnings, optimism, freedom and unlimited potential are traits I'm happy to be assigned, though!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Rodney.3": "I was patrolling the beach for rock crabs last night and saw Rodney getting attacked by one. He hammer tossed it right into the sea before I could reach them!$7#$b#Guy's an absolute beast! Next time he offers me his autograph, I might just accept it out of respect. You know, in case he does the same thing to me.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Rodney.4": "I see Rodney quite a lot at the library. He sure loves his sci-fi books. Pretty sure I caught him reading his OWN sci-fi book a few times.$1#$b#Gunther usually ends up telling us to keep it down because we nerd out a lot about aliens and shit.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Rodney.5": "I wish Rodney would close his curtains sometimes. I've seen things I wish I could unsee when he goes past the windows in the evening.$9#$b#I hope Dylan doesn't end up looking in that direction at the wrong time, I don't need him getting traumatised.$2",

//SEN

"Core.NovaEli.Sen.1": "I was really lucky to meet Sen when I did. He tried to threaten me but honestly, he looked so adorable that I was more inclined to hug him than stab him.$3#$b#I love being friends with him and Krobus. It's just a shame that I can't talk openly about it with other people. Well, except you.$2",
"Core.NovaEli.Sen.2": "I'd love to meet Sen's family in the mines, but he reckons it would be too dangerous. He doesn't want to risk a fight breaking out and I can see his point.$0#$b#From what he's told me about them, they're good people. Just very distrusting of smoothskin apes like us.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.Sen.3": "Sometimes when I try baking, I make extra and leave them wrapped up in the bin outside. I've got to look out for my buddy Sen.$1#$b#Occasionally I leave him other stuff as well, like yarn and books. It's worth it just to see the way he smiles.$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Sen.4": "One of these days, I'm gonna have to introduce Dylan to Sen. I reckon they'd get on well! It's not like Dylan's a total stranger to this sort of thing.$0#$b#Honestly, I could see them nerding out together and sharing book recommendations. It'd be super cute!$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Sen.5": "Oi @, check out my new socks!$3#$b#%Eli takes off a shoe and hops about on the other leg to show off the brightly coloured polka dot covered sock he's wearing.#$b#Sen knitted them for me as a present! Isn't that amazing??$3",

//MATEO

"Core.NovaEli.Mateo.1": "I usually work on my own when I'm doing Guild jobs, but it's always good when Mateo ends up coming with. There's nobody else I'd rather have watching my back.$0#$b#And I've got to admit, they've saved my hide a bunch of times now.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Mateo.2": "Have you ever been to one of Mateo's game nights? Normally I'm a bit too impatient for tabletop games, but Mateo's great at making it feel immersive and exciting.$1#$b#Last time, I managed to save our party from an Orc warband by seducing their leader with my boyish charm and roguish good looks. He had to let us all go after that!$6#$b#Aideen still won't look me in the eye.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Mateo.3": "{{EmeritusCommentary}}",
"Core.NovaEli.Mateo.4": "Have you seen Mateo's skill at knife throwing? I watched them nail a cave bat midflight in the mines, while I stood there with my sword waiting for it to get closer!$7#$b#They offered to teach me a few tricks, but Dylan would kill them if it went wrong and I came home missing a few fingers. And then he'd kill me.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.Mateo.5": "Mateo's knowledge on the supernatural is pretty impressive. It's cool to be able to chat about it with someone who can appreciate it as much as I do.$1#$b#Not sure how much experience they have with it beyond feral undead in the mines, though. I can probably show them a thing or two...$11",

//NORA

"Core.NovaEli.Nora.1": "I found a certain pink danger noodle lurking around the Scarp earlier and returned her to Nora before one of the cats could get hold of her.$1#$b#Pinkie Pie's the crafty one. I'm not sure if Stupid has the brain cells to even want to escape... ignorance is bliss, right?$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Nora.2": "I get nervous when I'm over at Nora's place. There's stacks of books and papers precariously perched everywhere - you'll get buried alive if you even sneeze in their direction.$9#$b#I'm speaking from personal experience! She practically had to dig me out under from her herpetology books.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Nora.3": "I'm trying to learn sign language for when Nora has her hearing breaks. She thinks I've got a good grasp of the basics already! And Dylan's been nothing but supportive.$3#$b#He thinks I should definitely continue conversing to her that way because it'll make the neighbourhood much quieter. Me and Nora aren't THAT loud... right?$10#e#...What do you mean you're not gonna answer that?!$7",
"Core.NovaEli.Nora.4": "The flannel shirt I saw Nora wear the other day looks really cool and... oddly familiar? It's nice to see people 'round here have good taste in clothes!$1#$b#I'll need to ask her where she bought it. For some reason a bunch of MY flannels have gone missing, but Dylan probably lost them when doing the laundry.$11",
"Core.NovaEli.Nora.5": "%Eli looks a lot more jittery than usual.#$b#Hi there, @! Just been 'round Nora's place for a chat over a mug of coffee. And then I followed that up with another two mugs!$1#$b#She went through a lot of our coffee supply last time she visited, I'm just returning the favour.$6",

//GINGER ISLAND

"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Entering": "What a stunning place, @! This is never going to get old, is it?$3#$b#I never used to be able to take vacations. It'll be nice to take a load off for once.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort": "Bit hot out here, isn't it? It's making me start to think twice about exploring that volcano, much as I'd love to poke around in there right now.$0#$b#There's probably all sorts of awesome lava monsters living there, though. And can you imagine the view from the caldera at the summit?$1#$b#I'm definitely going to check it out at some point when I remember to bring my adventuring gear. I'm not barrelling into an active volcano dressed like this.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Leaving": "I wish I could stay here longer, but Soot would never forgive me if I didn't come back to tell him I love him.$12#$b#I'll see you back in town, @. Have a good one!$0",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Shore": "You can actually see the other islands from here! I hear that there's supposed to be dinosaurs on one of them. And I bet that's not all they're hiding.$0#$b#They almost look close enough to swim to... but Dylan made me promise I'd stick to the shallows.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Wander": "I saw a pack of tiger slimes earlier! It's a pretty interesting adaptation to a tropical climate. I don't think there's any environment they CAN'T thrive in.$11#$b#They're no less aggressive than the ones you find back home though, so watch out for the little buggers.$1",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Wander_2": "I wonder if there's any lava monkeys living on that volcano? According to my books, they can swim in the forbidden soup like it's nothing.$1#$b#Their range is supposed to be limited to extremely hot surface environments, so sightings are scarce.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Wander_3": "One time I came here when it was raining so I could explore when there's less people around. I saw a gem bird! They're incredibly rare!$7#$b#Maybe I can ask Dylan to put in a good word with it for me so I can learn more. I'd love to see the look on the faces of the people who told me they're not real!$3",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Chair": "You said the PARROTs built this resort for you? No, no - I believe you! Stranger things have happened. Dylan told me they're really intelligent.$3#$b#He seems to enjoy talking to them. He said they're a lot less obnoxious than those crows and gulls back home. I'm sure Thistle will be abysmally jealous.$6",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Towel": "%Eli is fast asleep with a blissful look on his face. He's not even snoring. It looks like miracles can happen after all.",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Towel_2": "Hi, @! I told myself I'd explore the island, but tragically, I seem to be stuck to this towel. Nothing I can do, so might as well enjoy it. Oh well!$6",
"Core.NovaEli.Resort_Towel_3": "Aaaah...! I'm trying not to take this for granted, but I could get used to it! There's nice beaches back at Point Drake, but they're nothing like this one.$3#$b#That old lady on the west side of the island doesn't say much about herself, but she has some pretty amazing stories. Must be weird, having mainlanders like us around after so long.$0",

//ROMANCE (NEGATIVE)

"Core.NovaEli.RejectBouquet_NotDateable": "Oh, I've heard about this tradition! Fingers crossed that your special someone loves it.$0",
"Core.NovaEli.RejectBouquet_NpcAlreadyMarried": "I hate to point this out to you @, But I'm literally a married man. I'm pretty sure you were at the wedding. So the answer's no.$10",
"Core.NovaEli.RejectBouquet_Divorced": "Get back with you? Why would I want that now that I'm doing okay again? I've moved on, @. You should the same - this is kind of sad.$8",

"Core.NovaEli.RejectMermaidPendant_Divorced": "Don't take the piss, @. I know I make the effort to talk to you still, but that doesn't mean you get to walk all over me.$5",

"Core.NovaEli.RefusalNoHearts.B": "Oh, I've heard about this tradition! Fingers crossed that your special someone loves it.$0",

"Core.NovaEli.RefusalBother.B": "Now you're just creeping me out. Drop it, farmer.$8",
"Core.NovaEli.RefusalEngaged.A": "What the actual hell, @? You're engaged! I don't know what kind of person you take me for, but I don't want anything to do with this. Shove off.$5",
"Core.NovaEli.RefusalEngaged.B": "...Is this supposed to be a joke? I honestly thought you were better than this.$5",

"Core.NovaDylan.Spring.12": "Looks like the Egg Festival is on tomorrow. I don't understand the egg fixation for the day, but it's enjoyable. The food's great!$1#$b#You might want to get to it early or Eli's liable to devour it all. He's still salty that Lewis won't let him participate in the egg hunt.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Spring.23": "Why do I have to go to the Flower Dance? Why? I'd literally rather eat a bucket of broken glass than subject myself to that.$7#$b#What if someone asks me to dance?

"Core.NovaDylan.Summer.10": "Luau's tomorrow, farmer. Normally it'd be way too loud for someone like me but the atmosphere is actually really nice.$1#$b#The potluck soup is an interesting tradition, if a bit risky. You weren't here for Sam's anchovy incident, but it was pretty hilarious.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Summer.27": "Oh, man. You wait til you see tomorrow night's festival @. You'll love it.$3#$b#The same night every year, the Lunaloos stop by Pelican Town's beach on their annual migration.

Besides, HE works on Spirit's Eve.$5#$b#What can I say? We're both obsessed with our work.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.Fall.15": "Don't know about you @, but I'm tempted to spend tomorrow indoors. Lewis is about to open the floodgates and unleash a tide of obnoxious tourists upon us.$2#$b#Don't get me wrong! The Fair is fun. Just a bit too hectic for me.$9",

"Core.NovaDylan.Winter.16": "The Mermaids? Yeah, they're real! I've seen them from the submarine and no human could survive unassisted at those depths.

I worry about him going out in the dead of night.$9",

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.26": "Aideen's a nice neighbour, even though she is a complete anachronism. She's just missing a horse drawn carriage and some servants.$0#$b#You'd better mind your manners, though. Eli got a savage tongue-lashing from her when he swore in her presence. She threatened to wash out that foul mouth of his.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.27": "Sometimes Elliott offers me refreshments when I work near his place and asks about my studies. He's a good listener.$0#$b#He's the sort of person who always knows the right thing to say when you need it. So is Leah, come to think of it.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.29": "Willy was kind enough to bring me an angelfish the last time he went to the Fern Islands. It was just before you arrived, actually.$0#$b#I try not to play favourites among my pets, but she's probably tied with the octopus. Beautiful thing.$3",

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.30": "The marine ecosystem here is a rich and diverse one. I don't know if I could ever catalogue it all, but I'm definitely going to try.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.33": "Hey there. Keeping busy? It's stupid, but I've been doing some research into unexplained 'sea monster' sightings in the area.$0#$b#Eli reckons he's found and met one. Of course, he didn't think to bring his phone with him to get photos. He's probably just winding me up.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.34": "*Sigh* I had to pick up more litter I found on the beach earlier. Seriously, would it kill people to hold onto it until they reach a trash can?$8#$b#Marine ecosystems are fragile. A single plastic bag can cause all sorts of suffering many years from now.$0",

It's not easy to leave behind everything you've ever known, is it?$0#$b#Their track record on pollution is terrible.

Being so close to the sea, it wouldn't surprise me if there's at least one underwater cave system.$0#$b#I couldn't go cave diving though, no matter what kind of amazing ecosystem it might have.

Imagine what might be living there!$3",

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.47": "I always get this ominous feeling near that locked door to our guest room on stormy days. Makes my migraine flare up like nothing else.$9#$b#Why don't we use it? Well, maybe Eli will tell you one day. I try not to think about it.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.48": "Our family? We don't really talk anymore, we were never close. I haven't seen them in years. Eli can't stand them, and I really don't blame him.$0#$b#No, we consider our friends and neighbours here our real family.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.49": "I'm afraid I don't know much about agriculture. I have trouble just keeping our house plants alive! Don't suppose you can lend me a few tips sometime?$0#$b#You will? Cheers, @.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.50": "Eli picked up this new survival horror game recently - it's called Resident Weevil. It's about an insect who's trapped in an outbreak of zombie insects.$0#$b#Oh, I couldn't play it. But it's fun to watch for Eli's reactions alone, he gets really scared by this stuff.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.51": "Sorry @, I can't stop. Got a mountain of research to do! The practical work is fun, but there's also a lot of tedious writing involved.$0#$b#Maybe we can catch up later?$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.52": "Eloise has decided that I absolutely need a helper when I'm doing field work, and that she's the perfect candidate. So, yeah. That's apparently a thing now.$3#$b#She's a smart kid. As research assistants go, I could certainly do worse.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.53": "Ever been whale watching, @? I have. There's no experience like it, especially up close and personal on a boat. Their song is complex and beautiful.$0#$b#They're among the most gentle and intelligent animals on the planet. I'll have to take you with me next time.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.59": "I THINK I caught a glimpse of a strange creature in the ocean this morning that I don't recognise! Greenish scales and a vaguely humanoid shape.$6#$b#I might've just been imagining things. I blame Eli for filling my head with talk of a 'friendly sea monster'. It's a prank, surely.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.60": "I keep having these weird, vivid dreams. Obviously they're fabrications of my mind, but they feel VERY real. I remember them perfectly.$9#$b#Emily thinks that they mean something. Normally I'd say she's full of it, but now I'm having doubts.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.61": "Eli's actually got a formal education in monster research, from before he went off to do his own thing.$0#$b#I'm hoping to earn a PhD in my field. I'm actively working on it, but there's still a long road ahead of me.$1#$b#It's been a fun road, though! I don't regret any of it.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.62": "I opened my dresser earlier, then Soot leaped out and almost gave me a heart attack. I don't know how he even got in there!$5#$b#That's not even the strangest place I've found him in. You don't want to know where.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.63": "I had this cool idea for a lure that mimics the bioluminescence of deep sea fauna. I wonder if I can get Maru to help me with it?$1#$b#It pays to be friends with a robotics genius. She's been helping me out so much with her technical prowess.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.64": "I don't think I'm ever going to be fully comfortable around people, but my anxiety is manageable these days.$0#$b#I've partly got you to thank for that, @. You were patient with me even after my less than stellar first impression.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.65": "Elliott showed me a peek of his latest story. It's very well written, but there's a lot of gratuitous romance in it.$0#$b#Eli will love it, at least.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.66": "I didn't think it was possible, but Rosa managed to beat my Junimo Kart high score. Again!$6#$b#We have an ongoing bet. Whenever she manages to beat my record, I have to taste test her new recipes. Still, as penalties go it's quite an enjoyable one.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.67": "Did you know that sailors used to mistake manatees and dugongs for Mermaids long ago? It happened often enough that their scientific name is Sirenia.$3#$b#Actual Mermaids are real, though! I've seen them for myself during the Night Market from the submarine, although we still know little about them. This is one myth that both me and Eli can agree on.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.68": "I watched Willy fish up the most enormous conger eel the other day! A female that must've been at LEAST three and a half meters!$3#$b#We needed help pulling her out of the water so I could take a good look. I think she might even be a record-breaking specimen.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.69": "They've gone and opened a Cthulhu Mythos exhibit at the Literature Museum over in Fort Josa, but I'm stuck in the Valley for the foreseeable future.$2#$b#I'll see if I can plan something with Eli, I know he'd love to go as well.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.70": "It's been quite a while since I last saw a real mess on the beach. Looks like our efforts are finally getting through to people!$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.71": "That mouse has been in my room again. It's a very strange little thing... it was living in our house before we got there.$9#$b#We've never seen it properly, either. But it seems harmless enough, so we leave it be.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.72": "It's a real pain, having to wait for feedback on a project I've submitted. It was more a work of passion, but I like to think my research was well documented.$0#$b#They really don't need to make me wait ages like this.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.73": "Dr. Jacob's animal husbandry knowledge is as impressive as you'd expect - we even had a productive conversation recently over saltwater aquariums.$1#$b#I didn't realise how familiar he was with the subject. It's good to know my tank's in capable hands if I'm out of town.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.74": "I wrote a lot of my final papers in a cafe back in Point Drake. I picked that shop in particular because they made Eli's favorite coffee roast.$0#$b#I'd always try to bring one home to him - but don't tell him that. He'd get all sappy if he knew.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.75": "I wish Eli could do something about our guest room. Or the so-called Wizard. It would be nice to have some extra space instead of... whatever that is.$2#$b#I hate walking past that door. I keep thinking it'll open and that I'll find something nasty on the other side. I haven't been able to clean it since the incident!$9",

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.78": "The seagulls helped me out the other day when the wind blew my notes out of my hand - they actually brought them back for me!$6#$b#It's nice that they don't prank me as often these days, although their incessant talking still gives me a headache.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.79": "Emily came over to visit us and left with half of Eli's wardrobe. I don't know why she bothers repairing his clothes, he'll only wear them into the mines again.$9#$b#Still, she also offered to fix up a few of mine while she's at it. We don't deserve her, we really don't.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.80": "I got held hostage by Munchington yesterday when I was sitting at a bench. He sat on me and dug his claws in every time I tried to stop petting him.$1#$b#I was trapped there for two and a half hours before he got bored and left.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.81": "%Dylan is in the middle of yawning dramatically when you get his attention.#$b#Hi, @... I didn't get any sleep. But at least Eli slept well for a change. His snoring cut through the wall like a chainsaw and I'm all out of earplugs.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.82": "I wish Eli would buy his own soap instead of nicking mine all the time. The brand I like isn't exactly cheap at Pierre's.$2#$b#I would 'borrow' something of his in retaliation, but he's so disorganised that he probably won't notice.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.83": "Hi, @. You'll never believe this article they had the audacity to publish in a scientific newsletter I subscribe to! It was complete bull, have a look -!$7#$b#%Dylan launches into a lengthy, hard to follow tirade against the apparently abominable article that he's brandishing. Apparently someone didn't cite their sources!",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.84": "It's tempting to get a little hat for the tuxedo urchin in my aquarium. Did you know that they're covered in hundreds of tiny tube feet that they can grab objects with?$1#$b#Perhaps a hat will stop it from kidnapping my poor hermit crabs and parading them around. They always look so confused.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.85": "I've been getting into this new fantasy MMO called Realm of Rebellion. I didn't realise how addicting it is! Abigail, Sam and Sebastian play as well.$1#$b#It's a lot easier for me to be sociable with people when I'm hiding behind a monitor.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.86": "Hey, @. It's a nice day, isn't it?$0#$b#Unfortunately I can't stop to chat, though - I've got work to do. We'll catch up later, okay?$1",

I have to cover up the corals so that they don't get their food stolen from them!$1#$b#Wild cleaner shrimp will remove parasites from the mouths and bodies of client fish who wait patiently for their turn - even much larger predators. I love that sort of mutualism.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Spring.6": "I'm working on my PhD, but it's slow going.

"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.1": "Hi @. I, uh, managed to fall off the pier. Thought I saw a new jellyfish species and leaned over the edge to take a look.$9#$b#It was actually a floating piece of plastic.$5#$b#Gotta go and get changed before Eli sees. He'd never let me live it down.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.2": "If you're into fishing, you might find a pufferfish if you're lucky! They're quite active at this time of year.$1#$b#Just don't ever try eating one. Tetrodotoxin poisoning is a nasty way to go.$9#$e#And watch your fingers, because they have a powerful bite.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.3": "Hey, @. Hope you've been sleeping better than I have.$0#$b#The heat's bad enough without Eli's snoring. They can probably hear him from the other side of town.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.4": "If you're growing peppers, Eli and me will probably buy some. We both enjoy spicy food.$3#$b#How's your new life in the countryside coming along, anyway? Hope it's turning out how you wanted.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.5": "A few days each Summer, the ocean water turns bright green. It's caused by phytoplankton blooms that coincide with the crab mating season.$1#$b#You'll find a lot of coral and interesting shells washed up on the beach during this time.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.6": "Hope you're keeping hydrated, @. Nobody wants to find you collapsed from heat exhaustion.$0#$b#Especially considering how active you are - you remind me of Eli in some ways. Seriously, do you ever rest?$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.7": "I got an angry phone call from Aideen telling me to extract Eli from her rose bushes - he'd somehow wandered there at an unholy hour and passed out.$2I wish he'd stay at home and just read or watch TV when his insomnia plays up. I worry about him going out in the dead of night.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.8": "I get that dust sprites hate the Summer heat, but that's no excuse for Soot to get into our fridge. He made it filthy and somehow devoured half our groceries!$7#$b#I cleaned the fridge out, but Eli's replacing our food. He probably left the door ajar yet again and that's how the little bugger got in.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.9": "Get out to the beach early enough and you can find wild octopuses at this time of year. Good luck catching one, though - even Willy has a tough time with them.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.10": "This new game came out recently called {{GameName}}. We just bought it, I'm looking forward to trying it with Eli later.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.11": "I saw a Crimsonfish recently at the eastern pier of the town's beach. They're a very rare find and a protected species!$3#$b#Most of the year they're found in the open ocean miles away from any shore, but during Summer they visit the shallows to spawn.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.12": "I'm not sure what's worse. The stench when Eli gets back from an adventure covered in mud and slime, or his new cologne.$9#$b#Is he trying to impress people or put them in a coma?$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.13": "I might pay the Inn a visit later. Thank goodness that Rosa's place has air conditioning.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.14": "I rarely go to Cindersap Forest, but Eli dragged me out for a walk there the other day. Marnie invited us in for fresh glasses of milk and we chatted for a while.$1#$b#It's small moments like that which make me realise how comfortable I'm getting with the people here. It's really quite nice.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.15": "I think I should try exercising more often. I go out pretty much all the time, but it's not quite the same. I'd rather not do it with a group, though.$9#$b#Maybe I should ask Eli or even Alex for advice... he's nice enough, but I don't really talk to him beyond exchanging pleasantries.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.16": "Would you mind signing this petition, @? It's a campaign to stop the captivity of orcas in the Ferngill Aquarium, which is no place for such large and intelligent Cetaceans.$0#$b#Thanks for that. Unfortunately these orcas can't be released into the wild, but we're hoping to rehome them in a sanctuary run by a colleage of mine instead.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.17": "Nice weather, isn't it? I think Rosa's planning another neighbourhood barbeque soon, and you can bet that I'll be in attendance.$3#$b#Rosa's cooking is always wonderful. She has this knack for knowing exactly how everybody likes theirs done.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.18": "If I'm not mistaken, the percula clownfish in my aquarium are getting ready to spawn soon! I'll need to prepare a small tank for the fry to live in.$3It's always a warm feeling when you realise that your pets are reproducing. It's how you know that you're doing a great job of keeping them happy.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.19": "I had a pretty rough day yesterday because of a splitting migraine. Soot stayed with me most of the time though - like he wanted to comfort me.$0#$b#He can be sweet when he wants to. I know I moan about his antics a lot, but he's not all bad, you know?$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Summer.20": "I was going through our mail this morning and found one addressed to me. It was a... a love letter. It wasn't signed and I don't recognise the handwriting.$4#$b#It's got to be the wrong address or some other mistake, right? When have I ever given anyone the impression that I'm into them? I'm pretty paranoid now!$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.1": "My brother insists on us obeying all sorts of superstitions during Fall. Salt on the threshold, avoid black cats on your path, that sort of thing.$0#$b#I don't really understand the occult, but Eli's an encyclopedia on it. Let's say I've experienced some really inexplicable things before.$9#$e#Spend enough time around him and you'll know what I mean. He's like a magnet for the bizarre.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.2": "Willy occasionally takes me out on his boat, but I wish I had one of my own.$0#$b#Actually, no. I wish I had a submarine like the one at the Night Market. It would be scary, but fun.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.3": "Sea cucumbers become common at this time of year. And their rarer cousin, the 'super cucumber', is active from Summer 'til the end of Fall.$1#$b#They're actually capable of liquifying their bodies to escape predators before becoming a solid again. No other animal can do that!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.4": "Fall's great for camping. We sometimes go into the mountains or on the beach for a nice evening out.$3#$b#Eli's got a massive collection of horror stories. They're definitely more atmospheric when told under the stars.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.5": "Do I relax with some games later or continue writing my paper on the dioecy of local Hydrozoan species?$0#$b#Who am I kidding? Stupid question. Junimo Kart can wait a little longer.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.6": "Are you into video games, @? Eli and I are both pretty avid gamers. I managed to get the last achievement in {{GameName}} yesterday!$1#$b#It was one of those really obnoxious ones as well, but it was so satisfying to finally hit 100% completion. I'll probably end up replaying it sooner or later.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.7": "I'm trying to devise a new puzzle for Penelope the Octopus. They're intelligent creatures that enjoy challenges, such as food in jars they need to unscrew.$3#$b#Unfortunately, she also employs that intelligence against me on a regular basis. They are master escape artists - keeping her in the aquarium is like a game between us both.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.8": "I've got to order more nitrate, pH and calcium test kits soon. When keeping a reef aquarium you have to keep a close eye on a lot of water parameters.$0#$b#It's a delicate balancing act, especially with smaller ones like my nano tank where fluctuations happen faster.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.9": "Eli commissioned a painting from Leah ages ago, but I only saw it once when he brought it home. I've no idea where he put it. I didn't think he was into art.$0#$b#Not that I'm fussed... it was oddly ominous to look at and nothing like Leah's usual subject matter. No offence to her, of course.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.10": "Eli and I had a discussion about aliens recently. We both think they're real - the chances of our planet being the only habitable one are simply too low.$1#$b#But I was thinking - if we're seeing the stars as they appeared millenia ago because it takes light so long to reach us, what does that mean for alien signals sent our way?$9#$b#Would those aliens even still be around by the time we heard their message? I think I gave Eli an existential crisis with that question.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.11": "Fall's a really cosy season, don't you think? Crisp, cool air and earlier evenings. It's particularly nice here in the Valley.$1#$b#Eli loves to break out the horror movies at this time of year.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.12": "Did you know that there's a rare anglerfish species that migrates upriver around this time of year? It's very unusual.$3#$b#Willy reckons he's seen one visit the town river, but he's failed to catch it. Good luck if you try.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.13": "Fall's always profitable for a farmer, right? We're looking forward to buying a pumpkin or two from you.$3#$b#I hope you're not overworking yourself, though. Your health should always come first.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.14": "It gets a bit nippy at this time of year on Willy's boat, but I take any opportunity I can to get out there when he offers to take me.$0#$b#We saw a pod of orcas last time that came remarkably close to us. Later I'll have to show you the photos I took.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.15": "@? This is really embarrassing, but Thistle brought this home and I've got a sneaking suspicion that she stole it from your farm.$9#$b#I'll have a word with her later, I know she's not my pet but I still sort of feel responsible. Sorry.[272 270 300 274 284 278 282 595 398 276 280]$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.16": "I heard something rummaging around outside our house last night when I was watching a movie with Eli. I asked him to check - I mean, he's the one with a sword.$2#$b#He said it was just a raccoon, but I'm not so sure. I know perfectly well that there's monsters around the Orchard not far from our house!$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.17": "*Sigh* We have an apocalypse drill scheduled later tonight. Eli's planned out exactly where we'll go and what we'll do in the event of a zombie outbreak.$9#$b#He takes this sort of thing very seriously. I'll go along with it, as long as he isn't allowed to get his hands on a firearm of any kind. Knowing him, he'd maim himself with it.$2#$b#Also, I'm not to tell you or anyone else where his 'safehouse' is, in case any of you snap and resort to banditry after the fact. Sorry, @.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.18": "Sometimes Eli and I play board games when we're not busy. Last night, it was chess. I thought I'd won, but he trapped me without me even realising.$6#$b#I don't think HE realised as well until I was in checkmate. I sometimes wonder if his goofiness is just a front he puts up.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.19": "Has Eli been acting differently towards you lately? Like, way more energetic and excitable than usual? Talking really fast? Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about.$0#$b#He gets like that sometimes. I don't know what the cause is, but it's not a new development.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Fall.20": "I've never actually seen any of the cryptids that Eli chases, but he's convinced that they're real. And honestly, I can't prove that they DON'T exist.$0#$b#New species are discovered all the time though, so maybe there is some grain of truth to the Thresher Worms or Manticores said to live in Gotoro?",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.1": "Eli thought he'd get away with throwing a snowball at my face earlier. So I shoved one right down the front of his shirt. No regrets.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.2": "Any good at making snowmen? I'm not too bad at it myself.$0#$b#But you should see the abominations that Eli created last year. He had one big snowman being eaten alive by a horde of little zombie ones.$1#$e#Good job that Lewis doesn't visit East Scarp much. He would've lost it.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.3": "Hi @. Bet you'll be glad to get back into the warmth later.$0#$b#I should really invest in a warmer coat for when I'm working on the beach all day.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.4": "It was Winter when we moved to Pelican Town from Point Drake. I wonder if it's changed much since then?$0#$b#It was nice, but I don't miss it all that much now. The small town atmosphere suits me more.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.5": "I might end up visiting the Inn with Eli later. And by 'visit', I mean he'll drag me there because he thinks I 'work too hard'.$9#$b#Maybe he's right. Rosa and the others aren't bad... and the place is cosy.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.6": "If you're lucky, you might see squid at this time of year during the night.$0#$b#They're attracted to the light of places like piers, where they dart out of the shadows to snatch prey that swims by.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.7": "So what do you do to keep yourself occupied during Winter? You know, you could try your hand at aquaculture.$0#$b#Different fish can be rewarding to farm if you've got ponds to keep them happy in. I can give husbandry advice if you like.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.8": "There's a very rare fish called the Glacierfish that's only active at this time of year.$1#$b#It's only been sighted in Cindersap Forest, where it migrates upriver each year to lay eggs on the underside of glaciers. I don't think even Willy's caught one.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.9": "'Blobfish' get their moniker from their bloated appearance, but this is caused by rapid depressurisation when removed from their deep sea habitat.$2#$b#Surprisingly, the specimens caught around here are able to survive it. How they do so is currently a mystery to me. It shouldn't be possible...$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.10": "The hardest part about Winter is getting out of bed each day. I wish I could enjoy the warmth a little longer.$0#$b#Actually, no. The hardest part is getting ambushed by Eli for a surprise snowball fight. Watch yourself, @. He'll get you when you least expect it.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.11": "I've got to be more careful. I managed to slip on a patch of ice in front of people earlier, it was so embarrassing!$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.12": "Why is it that whenever this time of year comes round, they always play the exact same festive songs over and over?$0#$b#Surely someone out there is writing new ones, right? The classics get grating after a while when it's all you hear.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.13": "Eloise stopped by to compliment the snow goons earlier. I'm glad she sees the humour in them.$1#$b#Eli tries to outdo himself with them every year. We used to get complaints, but people seem used to it by now.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.14": "I almost dozed off earlier while sitting by the window and watching the snow fall over the Scarp. It's incredibly relaxing, isn't it?$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.15": "I kept Gunther past closing time the other evening. I'd like to say it was because I was engrossed in a new book, but I was just putting off going back out.$0#$b#Hopefully he'll forgive me for wanting to stay warm and dry at this time of year.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.16": "What a day... I had to dunk my arm into freezing seawater to retrieve my notes after dropping them. And then I got home to find that Eli had finished off our cocoa.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.17": "I worry about Thistle getting cold at this time of the year. I know that crows are used to it, but still.$0#$b#She said she's good and she'll nick a scarf from someone if she has to. Not on my watch she isn't.$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.18": "One of these years, I'm going to spend Winter in a warmer climate. I'm tired of making a spectacle of myself every time I go into town and slip on ice.$2#$b#I don't want to have to visit Harvey more than my annual checkup, thank you very much.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.19": "I think Eli wants to bring home one of those ridiculously massive pizzas that Gus makes for our dinner tonight. I can't think of a better way to warm up right now.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.6-10.Winter.20": "Pelican Town always looks gorgeous under a blanket of fresh snow during the Winter. It's very picturesque.$1#$b#It reminds me of the little model village houses that I used to see in shops at Point Drake during Winter Star sales.$3",

/*DYLAN NPC COMMENTARY
#BEARFAM
SIGURD/SONDRA*/

"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.1": "Sig once snatched a gull out of the air when it stole my notes on the beach. I'd never seen anything like it! That was surprisingly nice of him.$6#$b#The gulls were less impressed. You should hear the obscenities they scream when they see him these days.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.2": "The Bears are good neighbours. I don't talk to Sergeant Bear that often and he looks rough, but he's alright. Well, until he starts making those vulgar jokes.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.3": "I often see Sig loitering on the beach while I'm working. I expect him to throw his cigarette ends or Joja cola cans on the ground, but luckily he never does.$0#$b#He probably knows that Gudrun would lay into him if she found out.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.4": "I saw Sig thoroughly engrossed in poetry at the library. I didn't think he was the sort to appreciate that sort of thing, but he seems to be an enthusiast.$0#$b#Goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, doesn't it?$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.5": "I was checking my phone while walking back home and walked right into Sergeant Bear. I don't know how I failed to spot that blue haired... continental landmass.$7#$b#He just smirked at me and asked if I was alright after helping me up, but I was too embarrassed to say anything. It's going to be awkward next time I see him.$2",

"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.1": "Having Sondra around is very much what I imagine having an aunt would be like. She dotes on practically everyone around here, not just her family.$1#$b#I'm still not used to it at all.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.2": "While I was working outdoors, Sondra stopped by with a packed lunch. She was worried that I'd forgotten to eat... it happens sometimes when I'm engrossed in what I'm doing.$1#$b#She seemed to know exactly what my favourite foods are. I don't remember telling her. I wonder if somebody else did?$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.3": "I think Eli's plotting to rope Sondra into helping us dodge taxes. I'll have to stop him before she agrees to do it out of the kindness of her heart.$7#$b#We have enough problems without FRS agents rappelling through our windows in the dead of night.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.4": "I ended up watching three full episodes of Zuzu M.D. with Sondra at the Bear Lodge yesterday, followed by her insisting that I let her treat me to a homecooked dinner.$1#$b#I only popped round to return the game I borrowed from Gunnar last week! I ended up coming home much later than planned, but I can't possibly complain. The Bears take hospitality seriously.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.5": "Sondra insisted that I jump ahead of her while queuing at Pierre's, but that seemed wrong, so I told her that she should go first instead. She's older, after all.$0#$b#Followed by us having a back and forth about it until Pierre finally cleared his throat. Sondra won.$1",

"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.1": "I find myself apologising to Gunnar whenever he duels against my brother - I think Eli is a tad too overenthusiastic.$0#$b#Poor guy ends up on the ground more often than not. I'll have to have another word with Eli about it.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.2": "Gudrun is remarkably clever for her age. I'm usually a bit impatient around younger people, but she's great at following what I talk about.$1#$b#If she doesn't get arrested for ecoterrorism, I think she would have promise as a scientist.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.3": "I think Gunnar wants me to come over for a game night once I'm done with my work. We've mostly been playing versus, but we've been trying coop lately.$3#$b#He's got the newer, fancy consoles as well. And unlike Eli, he doesn't start whining when he loses.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.4": "Eli thinks that I've been spending too much time talking to Gudrun. He claims that her juvenile speech patterns are starting to rub off on me.$7#$b#Like, excuse me? What does he know? That's, like, totally not true at all!$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.5": "My GPU ended up dying on me, so I had to call off the raid I'd planned with Gunnar. It sucked, but I figured that would be the end of it.$0#$b#And then I find out that he ordered a top end replacement that's superior in every way to the one I had. Just casually handed it to me. I'm still in shock!$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.6": "Gudrun sometimes accompanies me while I'm working. I don't mind, since she shares my passion for what I do and makes herself useful.$1#$b#She even asks to borrow my notes so she can learn more. If only more people were as inquisitive.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.7": "Gunnar was telling me about the last time he went into the mines on his own. I don't know how those adventurer types can bring themselves to do it!$9#$b#I know that Dr. Harvey worries himself sick over them. But hey, it keeps him in business.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.8": "Gudrun was round our place while I was cleaning the aquarium, talking my ear off about that Navigator Lune show. Got to admit, it all went over my head.$0#$b#Eli teased her for her taste in TV and got shut down so hard that he was too embarrassed to say much for the rest of the visit. Serves him right.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.9": "We went over to the Bear Lodge last night to watch Beware the Mothman with Gunnar. It's more Eli's thing, but it's an interesting series.$1#$b#I still can't get over the size of that fancy TV they've got! I dread to imagine how much it cost, let alone the ultimate streaming package they pay for.$6",
"Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.10": "Did you know that Gudrun runs a blog about fish facts? She's really shown her work. I've contributed here and there for the sake of scientific accuracy.$3#$b#She also bullies big corporations on social media. I kind of feel sorry for the underpaid interns who have to deal with her shenanigans.$3",

"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.1": "If it weren't for the dogtags, I'd have a hard time remembering that Teren was a soldier. I picture them more like Sig, you know? Not as outwardly friendly.$0#$b#I was a little wary of him at first, but he's hard not to like.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.2": "Eli seems to get on well with Teren. Granted, that's a low bar - he gets along with anyone who's not an ass. But they hang out quite a lot.$1#$b#Hopefully he won't rope the poor guy into any trouble.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.3": "Teren's got rather good taste in video games. He's not a bad opponent either as it happens... he usually teams up with Eli or Sig, but that won't save any of them.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.4": "Teren was talking to me earlier and somehow we ended up on the subject of his poor luck with dating apps. He was asking if I... have ever had a partner.$0#$b#I've had people show interest in me before, but I've never felt those sort of emotions towards anyone. Well, not yet anyway. Sounds like a hassle, though.$9",
"Core.NovaDylan.Teren.5": "Teren seemed to be very taken with my aquarium when he last visited. It's always nice when people take the time to appreciate the work I put into it.$1#$b#He's an animal lover, too. Next time I decide to add a fish to it, I might let him choose the species.$3",

//RODNEY

"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.1": "I just had to fish up yet another autographed photo of Rodney. There's no end to the damn things! And Eli's even found them in the ground!$5#$b#*Sigh* As neighbours go he's not bad at all, but apparently his ego is big enough to have its own gravitational field. I'll have a word with him.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.2": "I ended up getting accompanied by Rodney when I was working on the beach. He's always kind to me, so it was a welcome distraction.$0#$b#We wound up talking about his latest novel and by the end of it, I'd completely forgotten to collect any samples.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.3": "On my way back home yesterday, I glanced up at the silo window and caught a glimpse of Rodneys's silhouette. I... don't think he was wearing anything at all?6#$b#That's going to make the next book club meeting at the library extremely awkward...$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.4": "I had to tell off Thistle again for pranking Rodney. She thinks it's funny to try and drop things on his head from the sky.$7#$b#So far she's only been successful a few times, but it's just a matter of time before she gets the other crows to copy her.$5",
"Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.5": "Rodney wants to read one of his books at our next Saturday night campfire. I don't think it's what Eli had in mind, but some variety might make it more fun.$0#$b#Rodney's stories are definitely more kid friendly than Eli's. Less likely to give you nightmares.$3",

//SEN

"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.1": "I've never seen this Sen character who Eli's friends with, but apparently he's the one who rummages through our trash at night. And he's not human.$0#$b#I thought the Shadow People are supposed to live far away from people. He sounds nice, though.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.2": "$action AddMail Current DylanSenNote received I found a little apology note left on our trashcan when I went to empty it. It was addressed to me... the sender said they accidentally knocked over the trash last night.$9#$b#Eli thinks that Sen wrote it. I've left my own note for him, saying it's okay and thanking him for cleaning up his mess. I wonder if he'll respond?$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.3": "Eli asked me if there's any books I don't mind lending to Sen. I think there's some fantasy and sci-fi books somewhere that he can take a look at.$0#$b#Maybe I should slip a few of my marine biology books in there as well.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.4": "I heard something moving around outside the house in the early hours and peeked out of my window just in time to see a dark figure with horns making a run for it!$6#$b#Eli thinks it's nothing to worry about, but what if they were some sort of murderous maniac trying to break in? I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight.$2",
"Core.NovaDylan.Sen.5": "Eli sometimes goes out on late night excursions to meet those Shadow People. If we still had a guest room, he'd probably be trying to bring them home with him.$9",

//MATEO

"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.1": "I wasn't sure what to make of Mateo when I first met them. Seemed like your typical rough adventurer type. Then I actually spoke to them and realised...$9#$b#They're a MASSIVE nerd. One of the biggest nerds I've ever met and that's coming from me. They're an excellent DM!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.2": "It's a good job that Mateo has first aid certification, because it's not uncommon for them and Eli to stagger out of the mine together covered in cuts and scrapes.$2#$b#I'd still prefer that he went to Dr. Harvey for treatment, but you won't get him in that clinic unless you literally drag him kicking and screaming.$9#$b#I speak from experience... I needed Mateo's assistance to do it once.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.3": "Mateo is well known for their hatred of crabs. Not just the invasive rock crabs that attack people - crabs of all species. What a weird hangup.$9#$b#Maybe they got their toe pinched as a kid or something? Either way, I'd better not catch them hurting any.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.4": "I caught Eli trying to throw knives IN THE HOUSE! He told me that Dr. Luis showed him a trick and he wanted to learn it for himself.$5#$b#I don't believe him sometimes! Clearly I need to have another word with Mateo - I don't think they realize how impressionable my brother is. He'll be trying to JUGGLE them next.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.5": "I know it's not Dr. Luis's field of study, but I've heard great thing about the marine biology courses available at the university they went to.$0#$b#If there'd been an exchange student opportunity, I would've taken it in a heartbeat.$1#$b#I might've even seen them on campus then!$3",

//NORA

"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.1": "Nora's going to be coming over later to watch a documentary on the Fern Island marine iguanas with me. It should be interesting to the both of us.$0#$b#Eli's hopefully going to pick up one of those XL pizzas that Gus makes, I can hardly wait!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.2": "I might have to pay Nora a visit soon. Partly to catch up, but mostly so I have a pretext to lavish attention on Pinkie Pie and Stupid for a while.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.3": "I actually considered pursuing herpetology before I was serious about marine biology. In another timeline, Nora might've been my colleague.$1#$b#But if you tell her that, I'll deny it. I don't need her trying to convert me.$0",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.4": "Has Eli said anything to you about Pepper Rexes lately? Because I've got the sneaking suspicion that he wants to capture one for Nora to study.$2#$b#Do I really have to remind people that this town is very flammable?$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Nora.5": "Sorry @, I've got a migraine flaring up at the moment. Spending too much time in the company of Eli and Nora at the same time will do that to me.$7#$b#Neither of them have an indoor voice. I swear you can hear them from the other side of town sometimes!$9",

//GINGER ISLAND

"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Entering": "I can hear the parrots welcoming us to the island. They enjoy having new visitors around. Looks like a wonderful day for it!$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort": "We're very lucky to be able to visit this place. The parrots told me that they set up the resort to reward your generosity.

"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Shore": "Goodness, I'm having a field day. I know I'm supposed to be relaxing, but I can't NOT take the opportunity to examine the sea life here!$1#$b#If only I had some snorkelling equipment, I'd be checking out the nearby reefs. Still, I'm having a great time.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander": "The parrots endemic to this island are fascinating. They're not really used to human contact, but they're keen to learn about us and share their stories.$1#$b#Apparently that boy... Leo? They said he spent most of his life alone with them. And that he understands their speech. I hope the sight of other humans isn't alarming to him.$0#$b#Maybe I should try getting to know the kid. After all, I share a few things in common with him.$3",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander_2": "I know it's inevitable, but Eli had better be careful when he decides to go into that volcano. There are no medical facilities on this island.$0#$b#Unfortunately, I can't tell him to relax on the beach without sounding like a hypocrite. But the work I've been undertaking here is decidedly less lethal.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander_3": "I had a chat with that curious bird trader further north. They barter in exchange for a random assortment of items found around here.$1#$b#I don't know what a 'Galaxy Soul' is, but they wanted 10 radioactive bars for it. I declined because I don't carry fissile material on my person.$0#$b#Yoba knows what they want it for, but I can't let Eli find out. I don't need him trying to find some in exchange for whatever that thing is.$7",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Chair": "This is the life! I'm probably going to shut my eyes for a bit and take a nap in the sunshine to the gentle lapping of the waves. It's so tranquil here.$3#$b#I never seem to get migraines while I'm here. All the more incentive to visit more often.$1",
"Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Bar": "I'm just taking a moment to enjoy a drink before I continue collecting samples from the shore. Gus has done an excellent job with this bar.$3#$b#I hope you're remembering to stay hydrated, @. I bought extra sunscreen in case you want to borrow some.$1",

"Gifts.NovaDylan.GiftReaction.RainbowShell": "Lovely colours on this shell! I've seen hermit crabs living in ones very much like it.$1",
"Gifts.NovaDylan.GiftReaction.DriedStarfish": "This is a well preserved Asterozoan. It's amazing to think that starfish were around as early as hundreds of millions of years ago, but still thrive today.$1",
"Gifts.NovaDylan.GiftReaction.Pufferfish": "Diodon! Not a bad find. It looks cute and goofy even when uninflated, but you wouldn't want to eat this - they're extremely poisonous.$1",

Rasmodius laughed in my face when I asked him for help, but you know what they say- if you want something done properly, you've got to do it yourself. I don't mind how long it takes or how many moldering old tomes I need to look through! I suspect that the Shadow Folk originated in that impossible place - perhaps they still dwell there.^^I'm aware that this undertaking carries a huge risk. Is the Void even survivable? Will the very sight of the other side make me go insane? Will our house still be standing? Let's find out!#Have I mentioned that I have very little experience with this? The weird things that I can do are a part of me. Materialising out of thin air in the blink of an eye feels as natural as walking. But actually researching incantations and trying to prepare a ritual is a different beast altogether. I'm no real sorcerer. I have no wizardly qualifications.^^WHAT AM I DOING?#Alright, experiment number one: I've been designing a new warp totem and just finished carving the prototype. I've got to admit, it gives me the heebies. I substituted most of the hardwood for monster bone and also added some void essence (ethically sourced!) and iridium ore (a pain to get hold of). The idea is to use this thing as a sort of focus for the portal.^^Fingers crossed!",
"Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.2": "Eli's Notes, Part 2:^^The warp totem experiment went pear shaped. When I began the spells, the totem started to resonate and I could feel the atmosphere in the room starting to change. Unfortunately, the totem burned out and fell apart after a minute even as the air around it shimmered and distorted.^I definitely felt something happening. I suddenly felt cold and... empty? It's the middle of Summer but my breath was coming out as mist. And I also somehow felt stronger.^^I'm clearly on the right track!#I was reading that art can be a good catalyst for magic. Trouble is, I'm not much of an artist and neither is Dylan. If I could get a decent painting of the Void, using special pigments made from certain ingredients, I might be able to use that in combination with the warp totem! But what does the Void even look like? All I know is that it's mostly empty. Would this painting HAVE to be accurate?^^Leah waved to me when I took a walk past her cabin in the forest this morning. I wonder how much she charges for commissions?^^This could work out nicely!",
"Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.3": "Eli's Notes, Part 3:^^I think we're just about ready! Leah did an amazing job with that painting. She made this dark, otherworldly vista dotted by islands and waterfalls floating in the nothingness. It's actually rather beautiful- I hope the real Void looks something like that. Of course, I didn't tell her what I need the painting for.^^Hopefully I'll still be able to hang it on a wall somewhere once this little project is all said and done. I also made a new warp totem, hopefully a bit stronger than the last one.#I've double, triple and quadrupal checked everything. If I don't screw up, the painting will form a small, stable portal to another dimension. If not... oh, who am I kidding?^^Nothing will go wrong. I'm looking forward to telling Dylan and old Rasmodius all about my success later!#(The following was written in a hurry. You can barely make it out.)^^It worked, but not how it should've. The painting opened and I finally saw the Void. What I saw defies description. Everything I thought I knew about the world has been turned on its head. But the portal is too unstable and threatens to spill out into the house and East Scarp. I'm both extremely happy and terrified! Rasmodius knows what's going on, he teleported into the room and got to work. He looks PISSED.^^Now he's shouting at me to get out immediately so he can seal the room off and put wards on the door. And he also said to take nothing out of the room- not even you, Journal.^^I'm sorry.",

I had a nice time!^^Anyway, I was carving some warp totems and figured that since you're so busy you could do with a few. They're paired up with the statue on your farm. Don't worry!

"CT.NovaEli.EliGuild": "I somehow let Abigail rope me into sword fighting practice with her. She's actually not bad at all as it happens.$1#$b#Hm? Of course I won! Pretty decisively, too. Like Abigail could beat me.$9#$b#%Eli walks away with a slight limp.",

"CT.NovaEli.DylanIntro": "I hear that you met my little brother at the beach earlier!$3#$b#Look, I know people think he's cold. But he doesn't mean anything by it, he's just... painfully awkward sometimes.$0#$b#He actually told me that he liked meeting you. But don't tell him I said that, yeah?$6",
"CT.NovaEli.DylanBeach": "Oi-oi, if it isn't the Trash Buster!$6#$b#Dylan said you teamed up with him to clean up the beach. Thanks for doing us a public service! Speaking of, I heard that Lewis got an earful about it earlier.$1",
"CT.NovaEli.DylanTown": "Dylan's going to be just fine, @. We marathoned this new documentary series on life in the Abyssopelagic Zone - really interesting stuff!$0#$b#I still feel guilty, though. It was stupid of me to let that happen.$2",
"CT.NovaEli.DylanSaloon": "Hey there, @. I'm sorry that Dylan made a prat of himself.$10#$b#I carried him home and he complained the entire way. Then he immediately passed out. I'm never, ever gonna let him live this down.$1",
"CT.NovaEli.DylanLibrary": "He's never going to admit it, but Dylan's actually very excited over being asked to help with that field trip.$1#$b#I reckon it'll do him a lot of good, so long as he isn't too condescending to the kids.$10",
"CT.NovaEli.DylanLesson": "Man, I wish I'd been there to watch Dylan's lesson. Penny said he handled himself really well! I'm so proud of him right now.$3#$b#I'm glad you helped push him out of his comfort zone. It really has paid off.$1",

"CT.NovaEli.SootIntro": "Thanks for stopping by earlier, farmer. It was nice to have you over! I think Soot likes you already.$1",
"CT.NovaEli.ThistleIntro": "That Thistle's a royal pain, isn't she? She adores Dylan, but she has it out for me. Come to think of it, she dislikes most people. He tells me what she says.$10#$b#I'm not surprised that he gets migraines all the time with her around. She's so loud.$9#$b#...What do you mean I have no indoor voice either?! THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL!$7",

"CT.NovaEli.SootPocketAdventure": "Teren borrowed one of my hoodies and got more than he bargained for. Soot was hiding in one of the pockets!$3#$b#I was worried my clothes aren't emo enough for him, but he doesn't seem to mind. And hey, Soot got to have an adventure.$1",

//DYLAN

"CT.NovaDylan.JojaBegin": "Well, shit. Looks like Joja won after all... hurray for even more pollution in the local waters.$5#$b#I suppose that Lewis had no choice, but still. This just sucks all around. It's hitting Eli pretty hard right now.$2",
"CT.NovaDylan.CCBegin": "So, is it true that you're trying to restore the Community Center? That's really impressive @. Not to mention ambitious!$1#$b#I want you to know that if you ever need a hand, you can count on us.$0#$b#And if you actually succeed, I call dibs on getting to stock the aquarium in there!$3",
"CT.NovaDylan.CCBus": "I hear that you got the bus up and running again! With a little help, apparently.$3#$b#I've wanted to visit the Desert for a while now. Not for the Skull Cavern- you'd have to be nuts to want to go in there!$9#$e#You'll probably bump into Eli there.$1",
"CT.NovaDylan.CCMinecart": "So, what's this about the minecarts being repaired overnight? That was you, wasn't it @?$1#$b#I doubt I'll ever need to use it myself, but I know Eli's thrilled. Hopefully he doesn't cause it to break.$3",
"CT.NovaDylan.CCComplete": "...Wow! I had a feeling about you @, but I didn't actually think you could pull off restoring the Community Center. You're incredible!$3#$b#I'll probably have a word with Lewis and Willy later, see about stocking that aquarium. I've got loads of ideas.$1",
"CT.NovaDylan.MovieTheater": "Hey @! Have you spoken to Eli today? He's meant to give you a little something from the two of us.$1#$b#Consider it a small thanks for running Joja out of town. It's been too long since I've seen a movie!$3#$b#You ought to join us sometime.$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingTrash": "I guess you've met Sterling? He, Henry and Mia are acquaintances of ours. They've been good to us since we showed up in the Valley.$0#$b#He's pleasant and funny. He's also a huge flirt, but I'm pretty sure he's just teasing.$1#$b#Or at least, I THINK he is.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingTrain": "*Sigh* Mia texted the other night asking if we'd seen Sterling, then Eli went and saw him heading up to the tracks in a drunken stupor. Again.$2#$b#Hope he doesn't get himself killed. It only takes one moment of carelessness...$0",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingShaneParty": "%Dylan seems to have one of his migraines again.#$b#Hi @... don't mind me, I'm used to this.$7#$b#Shane and Sterling probably feel a lot worse right now. And it's their own damn fault.$5",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingSwim": "Henry? I don't actually know that much about him. He's nice, but doesn't say much. I generally go my way and he goes his.$0#$b#From what I hear though, he's worked to the bone in Grampleton. I don't blame him for just wanting peace and quiet when he finally gets home.$2",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingBike": "I find it hard to imagine Pelican Town without Mia in it. From the start she's been like a big sister.$1#$b#Have you tried those bear pancakes she makes? They're out of this world.$3",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingDrugs": "Keep an eye on Sterling, won't you? Something's wrong with him.$0#$b#Eli of all people told me he was being weird, so I went up and asked him about it. Said we're always around if he ever needs to talk.$2#$b#He just laughed it off and said everything's fine, then he made up an excuse and left. But he was being really twitchy the entire time.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingRelapse": "We visited Sterling earlier. He's going to be alright, but seeing him so vulnerable like that is just heartbreaking.$2#$b#We're both there for him if he ever needs it, but I think he'd appreciate it if you dropped by as well, @. He always speaks fondly of you.$1",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingApology": "Nice to see Sterling back to his usual self. I heard he made up with Pierre and got his job back.$1#$b#*Sigh* ...Brace yourself for the flirting, farmer.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.SterlingRiver": "Sterling has my utmost respect for what he's doing right now. Eli and me both watched addiction destroy lives, back before we came to the Valley.$0#$b#But occasionally we've seen people overcome it. Support from friends and family can make a world of difference.$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.AnewCoupleInTown": "Looks like there's a new couple that just moved into the Inn.$1#$b#Or, should I say, ANEW couple. They seem nice enough.$3#$e#I get the feeling that Trace and Eli will get along like a house on fire.$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.SenMet": "Something's been going through the garbage around town. When I asked Eli about it, he just smirked and didn't reply.$0#$b#I'm gonna find him waist deep in a dumpster one day, aren't I. I'm already resigned to it.$6",

"CT.NovaDylan.LucikielArrives": "Just when I thought Morris couldn't act more like a third rate comic book villain, he goes and pulls a stunt like that.$5#$b#Still, that was really fascinating to watch. Eli's going to be talking about this non-stop now.$1#$b#Think this Lucikiel guy will turn him into an animal as well if he bothers him enough?$9",

"CT.NovaDylan.MeetTheCats": "Talking cats...? You mean you can hear them too?$6#$b#Yeah, we've seen them all over town. Live here long enough and you'll stop questioning the weird stuff.$0",

"CT.NovaDylan.MateoCaution": "I thought my brother was the king of lame puns, but then I met Mateo.$2#$b#They seem affable enough, but they're not really interested in talking. So we have that much in common.$0",
"CT.NovaDylan.MateoRescue": "Hm, so your first impression of the mine wasn't a good one? I'm glad Mateo was there to help you.$0#$b#I don't know how they or my brother can go in there, it's far too dangerous. Me? I'll stay above ground, thanks.$2",
"CT.NovaDylan.MateoLibrary": "I hear that you're the one who's been working on restoring the museum collection. Those are some interesting specimens you found!$1#$b#Imagine stealing from a museum, especially a small one like ours.$5",

"CT.NovaDylan.TalkWithGunther": "Heh, you met our neighbour Rodney? He likes to hold loud book readings from his balcony at 2 in the morning.$0#$b#I've spotted a few glaring plot holes in his books, but I don't want to tell him. It'd hurt his feelings.$2#$b#That, and he's a big guy.$6",

"CT.NovaDylan.elliott_writing_letter1": "We got letters from Elliott this morning. You got one as well? Yeah, I think he actually sends them out to everyone.$0#$b#It's good of him to take the time to do that. I'll thank him next time I see him.$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.GrandpaHaunts": "If I've told Eli once, I've told him a thousand times: I don't want him touching my stuff.$2#$b#I had everything in my room perfectly organised and aligned properly and they keep getting switched around. Does he think I'm stupid?$5",

"CT.NovaDylan.BearFamTimeForBees": "I think Sergeant Bear makes a game out of irritating me. He's so crude! But I suppose as neighbours go, he's not too bad.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.SigLowBattery": "Sergeant Bear kept telling me to repeat myself earlier and it turned out he was just joking at my expense. He could hear me perfectly well.$7#$b#I thought only old people did that.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.SondraAgingGracefully": "I can't believe Eli asked Sondra her age the other day. You just don't DO that to old ladies!$7#$b#From what I gather, she turned 50 recently. For the third time in three years.$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.NoraIntro": "Nora? Yeah, she's a good friend and a fellow scientist. She comes over pretty often to see documentaries with us or just to talk.$1#$b#It's like having a sister at this point. One who is just as loud as Eli.$9",

"CT.NovaDylan.LotV_CT_EveMeet": "I heard another explosion from Eve's house earlier. What is she DOING in there?$9#$b#She's nice enough, though. And Waffle is really cute!$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.LyellsIntro": "I've heard a lot of stories about people getting chased by Roswell. I'm pretty sure it's baseless slander. She's always very friendly towards me.$1#$b#I don't really know Lyell, but he seems kind and down to earth.$0",

"CT.NovaDylan.EliIntro": "Yeah, that's the face of someone who recently met my brother. He's always good at leaving impressions on people.$1#$b#I wouldn't worry about finding him on a roof or cliff. He's like an overgrown monkey. And it's been a good while since he last fell from somewhere.$3",
"CT.NovaDylan.EliSaloon": "Eli came home very happy from the Saloon. He said he liked your company. Thanks for humouring him, @.$1#$b#What do you mean I should join you at the Saloon next time?$6#$b#Uh... no. No way. I mean, thanks. But no thanks. That sounds dangerously close to socialising to me.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.EliJunimo1": "Eli's pretty convinced that he saw a Junimo in broad daylight, in public. You know, the little apple guys from local folklore.$0#$b#I'm not sure what to believe. It's hard to be a man of science sometimes when you live with my brother.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.EliJunimo2": "I've had neighbours asking me if Eli's okay because they saw him talking to himself again. He's fine, if you were going to ask.$2#$b#Fact is, he's rarely bothered by what people think of him. But I'm tired of making up excuses for his behaviour.$0",
"CT.NovaDylan.EliWoods": "Oh, hi @. ...You saw WHAT at the woods?$6#$b#*Sigh*... so you know, then. Yeah, things like relativity and the laws of physics have been polite suggestions to Eli for years.$0#$b#This was supposed to be a secret. I'll have to have a word with that impulsive idiot later...$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.EliOldWoods": "I want to know how Eli managed to lose that... whatever it was in my room. It didn't look hygienic, either.$2#$b#It WOULD be nice if he'd text me or something before showing up in there. One day I'll hide in his room and jump out at him, see how HE likes it.$5",
"CT.NovaDylan.JunimoKingIntro": "Hey, @? What's all this about you and Eli encountering a cryptid? He won't stop raving on about it!$0#$b#Wait, it really IS real? It isn't just a stag that got his antlers snagged in a bush?$9#$b#I don't know why, but I think I believe you. I've seen too much strange stuff by now to dismiss it as my brother's fantasies.$0",
"CT.NovaDylan.EliGuild": "Eli came home covered in bruises earlier. He said he doesn't want to talk about it, but I know he was meant to have a duel with someone.$9#$b#I suspect that his big mouth wrote another cheque that he couldn't cash.$3",

"CT.NovaDylan.DylanIntro": "Oh, hello again. It was... nice talking to you, I guess?$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.DylanBeach": "Cheers again for helping out. I had a chat with Lewis about my concerns and he said he'd see what he can do.$1#$b#I don't expect much, but maybe we've started the ball rolling on something good?$0#$b#I managed to collect some cool samples as well.$3",
"CT.NovaDylan.DylanTown": "That was extremely embarrassing. I'm sorry to have caused such a fuss in front of everyone.$0#$b#Still... I get to tease Eli for being afraid of Pam. Thanks for checking on me.$3",
"CT.NovaDylan.DylanSaloon": "Not now, @. I'm very hung over and in no mood to socialise.$7#$b#I did enough socialising last night that I needn't bother for the rest of the year.$0",
"CT.NovaDylan.DylanLibrary": "I've been planning activities for that field trip. Hopefully the little munchkins will enjoy themselves.$1#$b#...What? No, I'm not looking forward to it! Why would I??$6",
"CT.NovaDylan.DylanLesson": "That lesson went much better than I expected! I was rather enjoying myself, actually. I hadn't felt that confident in a long time!$3#$b#Thanks for believing in me, @.$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.SootIntro": "It was a nice change of pace to have a visitor. You're welcome to stop by whenever.$1#$b#Especially if it keeps Soot on his best behaviour. It's not like him to be that docile, especially around strangers.$9",
"CT.NovaDylan.ThistleIntro": "Sorry if Thistle left a sour impression on you. She was mad when she found out you didn't just leave your crops unprotected from her and her friends.$0#$b#She kept complaining about how unfair it is. But you losing your produce would be unfair. She'll just have to get over it, won't she?$1",

"CT.NovaDylan.SootPocketAdventure": "I hear that Soot infiltrated the Bear residence because Teren needed to borrow clothes from Eli. I hope he didn't cause too much havoc...$0",

//LEWIS

"CT.Lewis.EliIntro": "Eli and Dylan moved to Pelican Town just over a year ago, during the Winter. Dylan's the younger one. He's very quiet, but he's pleasant enough.$0#$b#Eli, the elder one, is very... exuberant. And a bit eccentric. He's harmless enough, but that wasn't the first time I've caught him on a roof.$3",

"CT.Lewis.DylanIntro": "Dylan has complained to me on numerous occasions about the beach pollution caused by JojaMart.$0#$b#I know he's right and that the garbage is an eyesore, but what can I really do about it? He'd be better off taking it to Morris.$2",
"CT.Lewis.DylanBeach": "Dylan cornered me again about the pollution problem. He showed me photos of the mess that you two cleaned up recently on the beach.$0#$b#I didn't realise that it had gotten quite so bad... what an embarrassment.$2#$b#He did give me some interesting ideas to promote awareness on this issue, though. I'll give it some thought. Thank you for the help, @.$0",

//EMILY

"CT.Emily.EliIntro": "Oh, hello @! I heard that you met Eli earlier.$0#$b#Some people think he's a bit odd, but he's a sweetheart, really. And he has such a bright aura!$1#$b#I enjoy hearing his stories when he visits the Saloon.$0",
"CT.Emily.EliSaloon": "I think I'll give the aquamarine that Eli gave me a special place in my gemstone collection.$0#$b#It has just the right energy that'll complement the others perfectly.$1#$b#Clint left shortly after you two did. He looked upset. I've told him before that he can confide in me, but he never does.$2",

"CT.Emily.DylanIntro": "Dylan doesn't come by the Saloon often. And when he does, he's always with Eli and doesn't say much.$0#$b#His eyes light up once you get him on the subject of sea life, though. It's adorable! I think he just needs help coming out of his shell.$1",
"CT.Emily.DylanSaloon": "I feel a little guilty, @. I did promise to keep an eye on Dylan for Eli.$2#$b#He assured me that no harm was done, and that he now has enough teasing ammunition for the next year.$0",

//HALEY

"CT.Haley.EliIntro": "Eli? He's friendly enough. And kind of handsome, in that scruffy sort of way.$0#$b#But he's SUCH a weirdo. Like, he makes my sister look downright normal.$3",

"CT.Haley.DylanIntro": "Ugh! I tried saying hello to Dylan because he's actually pretty cute, but he just stared at me and didn't say anything. Then he walked off.$3#$b#You've got one brother who ignores you and the other one doesn't shut up. What's with these people from East Scarp?$2",

//SHANE

"CT.Shane.EliIntro": "Eli caused one hell of an accident at JojaMart last year. It wasn't his fault, but it made the mother of all messes... which I had to help clear up.$3#$b#Worth it to see Morris squashed under those shelves. But he didn't find it funny and banned Eli from the store. What an ass.$2",

"CT.Shane.DylanSaloon": "Watching Dylan outdrink me wasn't on my bingo card this year. Never knew he had it in him.$0#$b#I bet he's already regretting it, though.$3",

//CLINT

"CT.Clint.EliSaloon": "I haven't got a chance, have I? I'm just not interesting enough for her...$2#$b#%Clint lets out a heavy sigh.",
"CT.Clint.EliGuild": "I got cornered by monsters in the mines the other day and barely made it out unharmed. Luckily Eli managed to retrieve all of my mining equipment.$0#$b#With that said, Marlon's fees have set me back a bit. I'd appreciate any work you threw my way.$2",

"CT.Clint.DylanSaloon": "I knew that Elliott and Leah go overboard sometimes, but Dylan too? The guy who barely talks to anyone?$0#$b#I had to leave when they got too rowdy.$3",

//GUS

"CT.Gus.EliSaloon": "I'm not sure if I believe half the stories Eli comes out with when he visits, but he's always been a gregarious sort.$1#$b#He's really interested in local folklore. He occasionally brings Dylan with him, but I still don't know a lot about them.$0#$b#Neither of them like to talk much about their past.$2",

"CT.Gus.DylanSaloon": "That was certainly an interesting evening, wouldn't you say, @? I'm glad that Dylan enjoyed himself, though.$0#$b#Eli tracked slime all over my floor, but at least he came back to help clean it up.$1",

//WIZARD

"CT.Wizard.EliWoods": "I gather that you saw some interesting things in the woods recently. Don't be so surprised - little in the Valley is hidden from one such as I.$0#$b#Eli's magic is curious, I must admit. Occasionally, mortals are born with a natural affinity for it that develops during adolescence if not sooner.$0#$b#But those attuned to the Void behind the world are a rare breed. Ironic given his sunny disposition.$0",

//DEMETRIUS

"CT.Demetrius.EliMushroomCave": "Hello, @! Eli brought me some fungal samples from the cave system that you two discovered.$0#$b#Several are species I can't find in any publications or databases, and a few may belong to an entirely new genus!$1#$b#I'm going to take Maru on a field expedition there soon. We're excited to catalogue the new ecosystem!$0",

"CT.Demetrius.DylanIntro": "Have you met Dylan? He's a marine biologist living in East Scarp. It's a rather respectable field.$1#$b#It's always nice to see younger people taking a serious interest in scientific pursuits. And he certainly knows his stuff!$0#$b#I bet I could still teach him a thing or two, though.$1",
"CT.Demetrius.DylanBeach": "Thank you for helping Dylan clean up the beach, @. We've always had a certain amount of pollution, but it's gotten worse since Joja came into town.$0#$b#I worry about the deleterious effects it's having on the local ecosystem. Something needs to be done about it.$2",

//MARU

"CT.Maru.EliIntro": "Oh, you met Eli? He's certainly something, isn't he?$1#$b#He's a cryptozoologist, but I don't believe in that sort of pseudoscience. He's definitely knowledgeable on real monsters though.$0",
"CT.Maru.EliMushroomCave": "I had to help Harvey treat Eli earlier when he came back from that trip with you.$2#$b#He's fine, despite acting like a cornered animal when he came to the clinic.$0#$b#He made a run for it as soon as Harvey asked him about booking a follow up appointment!$1#$b#Dad's really excited about the fungal ecosystem you guys found. We're going to take a look for ourselves soon.$3",

"CT.Maru.DylanIntro": "It's exciting to have a marine biologist living in Pelican Town! I think Dylan might actually know more about the local marine ecosystem than Dad.$1#$b#He's always been withdrawn, though. He's obviously passionate about his field of expertise, but he doesn't seem to like engaging with people.$2",

//Leah

"CT.Leah.EliIntro": "Oh, Eli was on a roof again? I thought I heard Lewis yelling at him earlier.$2#$b#People criticise him for being unconventional, but it's like water off a duck's back to him. I can respect that.$7#$b#Plus he appreciates my art. He commissioned me once when I really needed the cash.$1",
"CT.Leah.EliJunimo1": "Eli asked me if I believe in magic. In things like Junimos and ghosts.$0#$b#I try to keep an open mind about these topics, but I haven't personally seen any evidence for it.$2#$b#Who knows? Maybe some people have a different way of seeing the world that lets them perceive things the rest of us can't.$7#$b#I mean, as an artist I try to view the world through a different lens as well. It's an interesting thought, right?$1",

"CT.Leah.DylanIntro": "Dylan's a bit mysterious, isn't he? I see him quite often when I go to the beach to make sketches.$0#$b#I try to make small talk with him while he's scribbling in his notebook, but it's hard to tell if he's actually listening. He's in his own little world.$2",
"CT.Leah.DylanBeach": "The beach looks a lot nicer now. Thanks for your help with that, @!$0#$b#I've had to do that a few times before, on the beach and in the forest, but it's almost never THAT bad.$2",
"CT.Leah.DylanTown": "Dylan stopped for a chat earlier. I'm glad to see him feeling better.$0#$b#We both had a laugh at the look Eli had on his face when Pam accosted him. Doesn't he deal with monsters for a living?$1",
"CT.Leah.DylanSaloon": "Hi, @! I'm sorry that we got a tad carried away the other night.$0#$b#We must do it again sometime!$1",

//ELLIOTT

"CT.Elliott.EliIntro": "Aha! That is the look of somebody who met the positively ebullient Eli recently. What a character that man is.$0#$b#I don't believe I'd ever met anyone with such an infectious energy before he and Dylan moved to the Valley, not long after myself.$1#$b#He's surprisingly well read, too. He often inquires after my literary aspirations... and he tells the most thrilling horror stories.$0",

"CT.Elliott.DylanIntro": "Dylan's work often takes him near my shack. He may not be much in the way of socialising, but he never says no to the offer of a hot beverage.$0#$b#Sometimes he talks about his work whilst I listen. I get the impression that he does appreciate my occasional companionship.$1",
"CT.Elliott.DylanBeach": "Hello, @. As much as I appreciated your efforts, I'd like to profusely apologise for being unable to assist you and Dylan earlier.$2#$b#I was held captive at my writing desk by a brilliant spark of inspiration that I had to commit to paper before I forgot.$0#$b#Such is the peril of being an aspiring writer.$1",
"CT.Elliott.DylanTown": "Do you think that Leah and I came on a bit too strongly when we extended our offer to Dylan? I'd hate to think that we scared him off.$2#$b#Still, he did say that he would consider joining us. It is more than we'd hoped for.$1",
"CT.Elliott.DylanSaloon": "Oh dear... I fear that our revels left poor Gus's establishment in quite a state.$2#$b#I hope that you enjoyed yourself though, @.$1",

//HARVEY

"CT.Harvey.EliMushroomCave": "Eli stopped by earlier, covered in cuts and scrapes. And not for the first time, either. It was all Maru and I could do to get him to stay still long enough to treat him!$2#$b#I'm glad that you were with him when he fell, @. It could've been a lot more serious if he'd landed differently.$0#$b#I worry about these adventurer types, going into dangerous places all the time.$2",

"CT.Harvey.DylanSaloon": "I bumped into Eli on my way out of the Saloon and tried to check him over. Apparently the skirmish over at the mines was a big one.$0#$b#He refused and ran past me. I think Dylan had too much to drink as well... what'll I do with those two?$2",

//ABIGAIL

"CT.Abigail.EliIntro": "I've seen Eli going into the mines before. I think he does part time work for the Adventurer's Guild? I kind of envy him.$0#$b#Do you think he'd let me try out his sword if I bug him enough?$1",
"CT.Abigail.EliWoods": "I looked out of the window at the town square last night and saw Eli... flickering into the shadows and reappearing on top of a roof. He didn't see me.$3#$b#I always figured there was something strange about him. I know it sounds crazy, but I know what I saw.$2#$b#I wish I could do that...$1",
"CT.Abigail.EliGuild": "I totally defeated Eli in a sword fight! You should've seen me, @ - I knocked him on his ass!$1#$b#Sure, he got some good hits in - but if I can beat someone who works for the Guild, then how tough can the mines be?$0",

//PIERRE

"CT.Pierre.EliGuild": "I think Abigail's been fighting again. She came home covered in dirt and bruises.$2#$b#It had better not be Sam or Sebastian again! I really don't need to have another word with their mothers.$3",

//SEBASTIAN

"CT.Sebastian.EliJunimo1": "I never really know what to make of Eli. He's nice and all, but the way he talks and acts sometimes... I'm not sure if he's all there.$2#$b#The crafty way he grins at you, like he knows something you don't. And he KNOWS that you know he knows you don't know.$0#$b#I'm not judging him, though. I'm a bit weird myself. So's Abby.$1",

//WILLY

"CT.Willy.DylanIntro": "I like that Dylan. Sometimes he asks to see my catch for his research. He knows better than many that the ocean deserves respect.$0#$b#He and Eli are from Point Drake along the coast - I've been there before. They're both good lads, even if one's rowdier than the other.$1",
"CT.Willy.DylanBeach": "The sea's been a cruel mistress to me as of late. I've been catching more junk than fish!$2",
"CT.Willy.DylanSaloon": "Heh heh, I wasn't expecting to see Dylan get so comfortable so soon in the Saloon.$1#$b#I'm glad the lad's starting to come out of his shell at last.$0",

//PENNY

"CT.Penny.DylanLibrary": "Hello, @. I honestly didn't expect Dylan to agree to help me in a million years!$1#$b#I'm looking forward to seeing him teach. Although naturally, I'll be on hand as well.$0",
"CT.Penny.DylanLesson": "Wasn't Dylan amazing, @? The children had such a good time! Maybe I should convince him to give lessons more often.$1#$b#I hope the experience gave him a boost in confidence. I honestly think he surprised himself.$0",

//VINCENT

"CT.Vincent.DylanLibrary": "Miss Penny says that we're going on a field trip to the beach!$0#$b#I'm gonna put a crab in Jas' hair when no one's looking.$1",
"CT.Vincent.DylanLesson": "Mister Moray's lesson was so cool! I hope he teaches us about sharks next time.$1",

//JAS

"CT.Jas.DylanLibrary": "I'm super excited for that field trip! Mister Moray's going to teach us. Miss Penny said he's very smart.$1",
"CT.Jas.DylanLesson": "That field trip was really fun! Wasn't that octopus cute?$1",

They'd even steal children and raise them as their own!$1",
"Events.EliPrototype.Question.3.Response.2": "It depends. You're thinking about the old tales where many faeries were fickle, vindictive folk.

"Events.DylanIntro.Question.1.Response.1": "Fair enough. It's a beautiful place, isn't it? 'Where Heart Meets Ocean'.$1#$b#Reminds me of our old home at Point Drake, but much quieter. Which suits me just fine.$0",
"Events.DylanIntro.Question.1.Response.2": "Oh, you're the social sort. Interesting.$0#$b#Well, you can't go wrong with the people here. Some of them have their quirks, but they're all decent.$1#$b#There's also my brother Eli of course. He's a lot more gregarious than I am. Maybe you've already met him.$0",
"Events.DylanIntro.Question.1.Response.3": "...$9#$b#...Right. Okay then.$9",
"Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.3": "I'm just out here to do some field research. I'm a marine biologist, so you'll often find me by the ocean.$0",

"Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.5": "Here, take a closer look.$0",
"Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.6": "It's really cool, isn't it? Tide pools like this one are everywhere, but not many people stop to appreciate them.$3#$b#They're little oases that offer us a small glimpse of life under the sea.$1#$b#And the best part is that they transform every day as new creatures move in or out. It's always a bit different.$3",
"Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.7": "There's all sorts of theories on where life originated. It could've been by hydrothermal vents down in the abyss... or maybe even terrestrial pools like this one.$0#$b#But yeah, this is what I do. I don't only study tide pool ecosystems of course, but they're one of my favourites. It's very relaxing.$1#$b#Heh. Sorry, I got a bit carried away. I don't want to bore you.$9",

I know there's only so much he can do, but surely he doesn't want his town to be a pit of squalor?$1#$b#Back in Point Drake, the problem was worse because of higher population density and apathy in the city council.

"Events.DylanTown.Question.1.Response.2": "Yes, but not often. And always when Eli's with me. He helps me feel grounded in situations that would overwise overwhelm me.$9",
